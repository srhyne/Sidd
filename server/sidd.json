Note that if there are no suspended tickets, we're not going to send you a blank email every 10 minutes ;)<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you're settled on a frequency, add the email addresses you would like to notify in the text area -&nbsp;separating&nbsp;them out by commas.<\/p>\r\n<h2>2. See your forum subscribers and voters<\/h2>\r\n<p>Agents, with moderator&nbsp;privileges, are now able to see who is subscribed to a forum or a topic.&nbsp;<br \/><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/lm3axp4khhkzrwm\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-06-01_at_11.53.37_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-06-01_at_11.53.37_AM.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>As well as being able to see who voted.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/fb2ilhiww41lf1o\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-06-01_at_11.53.44_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-06-01_at_11.53.44_AM.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Simply click on the numbers, and you'll be shown a detailed list of who subscribed or voted.<\/p>\r\n<h2>3. Agents can select to tweet a Twicket URL on-demand<\/h2>\r\n<p>Previously, only Admins could make the choice of including a Twicket URL in outgoing Tweets or not - so Agents never had the choice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To let your Agents choose whether to include the Twicket URL in outgoing Tweets or not, simply go to Settings &gt; Channels &gt; Twitter and uncheck the following option in the \"General settings\" tab:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/yshxe6hc8bgmv39\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-06-01_at_11.58.35_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-06-01_at_11.58.35_AM.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Now, your agents can choose ad-hoc when they want to include the URL:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/le1lqrp6jiifkf9\/?name=SUPPORTen.png\" alt=\"SUPPORTen.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2>4. Admins can now change a public comment to private<\/h2>\r\n<p>So you've made a big mistake and accidentally put something into a public comment which you shouldn't have. But, you don't want to ruin your audit trail by deleting the ticket, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Admins can now change public comments to private, to cover up life's little blunders.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/qeduegbuo5bpn4a\/?name=__Simon_Wistow__Testing_sentiment_-1.png\" alt=\"__Simon_Wistow__Testing_sentiment_-1.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Note that due to the sensitive nature of this, there's a few restrictions<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>This is an&nbsp;irreversible&nbsp;process. Once a public comment is made private, it may not be switched back.<\/li>\r\n<li>The email notifications that went out will remain as such, it's not possible for us to \"undo\" sent emails.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Private comments may not be made into Public comments.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>So, use with a little bit of caution.<\/p>\r\n<h2>5. Say hello to Gravatar<\/h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gravatar.com\/\">Gravatar<\/a> is a cool little service which hosts your profile image for you. When you upload a profile image, you tie it to your email address. This means that if you give someone like Zendesk an email address, we can ask Gravatar if they hold a profile image for that email address.<\/p>\r\n<p>If they do, we'll display the profile image Gravatar gave back to us. You and your customers don't need to lift a finger to make this happen. If a profile image was upload through Zendesk, we'll use that rather than Gravatar.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>6. Prettier layouts<\/h2>\r\n<p>We\u2019ve also been working on improving parts of our interface yet again. Most notable is the styling changes to editing profiles. You\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s now more in-line with our other settings pages, and nicely splits out into manageable tabs.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/gn1edupahzg7yng\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-06-02_at_10.27.28_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-06-02_at_10.27.28_AM.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Second, our views have seen a small enhancements to keep them looking nice and modern.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/lm01qx4aispoov3\/?name=SUPPORTen___All_unsolved_tickets__112_.png\" alt=\"SUPPORTen___All_unsolved_tickets__112_.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>As well as this, we've improved how &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; markup renders in forum topics.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/82xncakm5qvv8ss\/?name=I_would_like_the_moon___Jake_s_Account.png\" alt=\"I_would_like_the_moon___Jake_s_Account.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2>7. Other New Stuff<\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Profile pictures may now be included in API calls when creating or editing users. Just pass in remote_photo_url with a publicly accessible URL, and Zendesk will suck it in and save it as that users profile image. For example: <br \/>\r\n<pre>POST \/users.xml\r\n\r\n&lt;user&gt;\r\n  &lt;email&gt;aljohson@yourcompany.dk&lt;\/email&gt;\r\n  &lt;name&gt;Al Johnson&lt;\/name&gt;\r\n  &lt;remote-photo-url&gt;http:\/\/www.example.com\/photo\/me.png &lt;\/remote-photo-url&gt;\r\n  &lt;roles&gt;4&lt;\/roles&gt;\r\n  &lt;restriction-id&gt;1&lt;\/restriction-id&gt;\r\n  &lt;groups type='array'&gt;\r\n    &lt;group&gt;2&lt;\/group&gt;\r\n    &lt;group&gt;3&lt;\/group&gt;\r\n  &lt;\/groups&gt;\r\n&lt;\/user&gt;\r\n<\/pre>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>Profile pictures may also be set via Remote Authentication. Be sure to pass back <code>remote_photo_url<\/code> as a URL parameter, and include it in your hash if you do include a URL.<\/li>\r\n<li>Requester names may now be set via the Mail API using <code>{{requester:jake@zendesk.com requester_name:\"Jake Holman\"}}<\/code> for example.<\/li>\r\n<li>Closed tickets can now be added to forums, just like open tickets can.<\/li>\r\n<li>Agents can use Zendesk placeholders in all ticket interfaces. This was previously only possible when doing bulk update. With this change, you can insert a placeholder and it will be resolved after the ticket form is saved. Useful for things like responding to a problem ticket and having the requester names replaced in the linked incidents.<\/li>\r\n<li>We've fully documented how we support the \"Liquid\" API so you can fully customize just about anything you want:&nbsp;https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20134837-using-liquid-markup-to-customize-comments-and-email-notifications<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>We really hope you enjoy all of these awesome updates!

We apologise if this is of&nbsp;inconvenience&nbsp;and you actually <em>did<\/em>&nbsp;mean to display these widgets to end-users, you can simply edit these widgets to put them back into the view of End-Users.<\/li>\r\n<li>Zendesk was occasionally not resizing profile images, which resulted in a mixture of large and small profile pictures all of the place. This has now been resolved.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>When using the Search API to find a ticket by ID, we weren't honoring the requested return format of XML or JSON, this is now fixed.<\/li>\r\n<li>Those accounts with a large number of agents and the agent assignee auto-complete were seeing edge-problems in Firefox and Internet Explorer which should now be resolved.<\/li>\r\n<li>The Zendesk dropbox validation was a little too harsh on when validation was performed. We've pulled this back a little so the flow of completing a submission form is no longer as&nbsp;intrusive.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>A drop-down custom fields in the Zendesk dropbox was bypassing required validation, which should no longer happen.<\/li>\r\n<li>Zendesk chat was negatively affected by a change made for SSL within the Zendesk dropbox. This change was reverted and chat was fixed during the week.<\/li>\r\n<li>Occasionally the Pivotal Tracker Target would fail to get tickets to Pivotal.

Each collection of users is defined as follows:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">Organizations<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">Organizations are collections of your users (both end-users and agents). Each user can             be added to only one organization. The use of organizations is optional, but by             arranging your end-users into organizations you can keep track of what those             organizations are requesting. You can also enable users within an organization to see             each other\u2019s tickets.

First, let's define that we mean by end-user. These are the people         that generate support requests. They are your customers in a retail setting and the         employees that are supported by an internal help desk in a corporate setting (to name two         common types of end-users). How you organize your end-users is entirely up to you; however,         here are a few examples of how organizations can be used:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To support service level agreements<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">You can create organizations that mirror the service level agreements that you've               established with your customers. For example, your paying customers are guaranteed a               faster response than those who use your free services and you want to distinguish               between the two. Or, perhaps you've set up levels of support based on which version of               your products and service levels your customers have purchased (for example: basic,               professional, enterprise or silver, gold, platinum). You can create organizations for               each set of customers and route them through the help desk workflow accordingly. You               can then create business rules and reports to escalate tickets as needed and to track               performance against your service level agreements. <\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To track and manage tickets by company<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">Perhaps you sell your products to other businesses. You can create organizations for               each of those companies to manage and track their ticket activity.<\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To manage requests based on email domains<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">You can automatically add end-users to organizations based on their email domain.               For example, you might have both internal and external end-users. You can create an               organization for your internal end-users and automatically add them to the               organization, based on their email domain, the first time they submit a request. The               new request is then picked up in the workflow rules you've set up for that               organization. <\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To support customers by location and language<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">If you support organizations or individual customers across the globe, you can               create organizations for locations and languages and then route those requests to               agents that are co-located and speak the same languages. <\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To define access to forums<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">You can use organizations to define who can see what in your forums. You might want               most of your forums to be viewable by all your end-users but also create several just               for certain groups of users (customers with premium service plans perhaps).               Organizations allow you to do this. When you create a forum, it is by default viewable               by everyone. If you want to restrict access to it, you simply select the one               organization that you will allow to see it. <\/dd> <\/dl><\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can create organizations and add end-users to them manually, one at a time, or automate         the process by adding users and their organizations in a bulk import operation.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Agents can also be added to an organization. You might do this as part of organizing the         users in your help desk or to restrict an agent's access to only the organization they         belong to (this is an option when setting the agent's privileges).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Once you've gotten organizations set up, they can be used in many ways in the help desk to         manage the workflow. See <a href=\"#topic_uhb_xlq_ac\" class=\"xref\">How to use your           organizations and groups<\/a> below.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_qsg_zkx_ac\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_qsg_zkx_ac\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Agents and groups<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Groups are only for agents and every agent must belong to at least one group. Like         organizations, how you set up groups depends on your business needs and the help desk         workflow you prefer. Here are some of the common ways that groups are used:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To escalate tickets based on complexity<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">You can manage escalation by setting up a tiered support group structure. For               example, you can create groups for levels of support based on factors such as urgency               and complexity. By default, you could assign all tickets to the Level 1 group and then               escalate them to Level 2 manually based on the technical complexity of the issue. The               Level 2 agents (who may also be members of the Level 1 group) have the advanced               technical skills needed to resolve the issue. For an example of this, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/276293-escalating-your-tickets-with-groups\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Escalating your tickets with groups<\/a>.<\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To support service level agreements<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">As in the example for organizations above, you can set up corresponding groups to               support organizations defined by service levels. <\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To provide support by expertise<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">You can create groups based on expertise. For example, a company that develops both               software and hardware might place the agents who support the software into one group               and those agents who support the hardware in another. A custom field could be added to               the support request form prompting end-users to specify the product they're seeking               support for and this could be used to route the ticket to the appropriate group.<\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">To support customers by location and language<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">As noted above, you can set up organizations by location and language and then               assign agents (or groups) to their tickets. Even if you didn't set up organizations               for this, you can route to tickets to these groups based on the end-user's email               domain (<em>somecompany<\/em>.fr, for example) or their language preference. <\/dd> <\/dl><\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">When you create groups, you can add existing agents to them. You can add new agents to one         or more groups when you're adding them to the help desk. You can also bulk import new users         and define their role as agent; you then manually add them to groups.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_mbq_ixx_ac\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_mbq_ixx_ac\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">How groups support organizations<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">So how do groups support organizations? In the broadest sense, simply by becoming hubs of         support for the tickets that are received from the end-users in your organizations. What         group is assigned to an organization's tickets can be based on the many considerations         outlined above (help desk escalation processes, security, co-location and language, and so         on).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can take a loose approach to this and just allow agents to triage and assign requests         to groups based on their reading of the support request or you can create business rules to         handle that automatically. See <a href=\"#topic_uhb_xlq_ac\" class=\"xref\">How to use your           organizations and groups<\/a> below.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can also more tightly manage the workflow and create security boundaries by funneling         tickets directly to agents who have restricted access. This means that they can only see the         tickets that they are allowed to see. You can do this in two ways. The first is to add the         agents to groups and then restrict their access to only those groups. You can also add an         agent to an organization, which restricts their access to only those tickets that are         submitted by end-users in that organization.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> In Zendesk, you'll see references to <em>non-<\/em><em>restricted agents<\/em>.

people who generate       support requests, those who resolve them, and the tickets themselves.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Users and people are essentially equivalent terms; it's the broadest definition for all       people who use the help desk. When you need to manage people in the help desk, your starting       point is almost always <strong>Manage &gt; People<\/strong>. This is where you add new users, define their       roles and privileges, and then organize them using groups and organizations. You'll usually       only see the word <em>users<\/em> in documentation like this.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Each user's role is defined when they are added to the help desk. And, when users log in,       they are only shown the parts of the help desk that they are allowed to see and use.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_hlt_cbp_cc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_hlt_cbp_cc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">End-users, or customers<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">End-users are also sometimes referred to as customers. These are the people who generate         support requests from any of the available support channels (Web portal, email, Twitter,         etc.). They don't have access to any of the admin and agent features of the help desk. They         can only submit and track tickets and communicate with agents publicly (meaning their ticket         comments can never be private).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">How end-users interact with your help desk depends first on the support channels they have         available to them and then by how you've defined public access. You can run an open or         closed help desk. Open means that anyone can submit tickets. Closed means the opposite, and         as you might imagine, it's how you'd set up a help desk for an internal support operation         for a corporation, for example. In a closed help desk, you add the end-users. In an open         help desk, you can add users yourself and end-users can add themselves by submitting         tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can either require end-users of an open help desk to register, or not. In a closed help         desk, all end-users must be registered of course.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can also control if and how your end-users access the help desk Web portal. This is the         end-user's view of the help desk and includes the submit request page, the knowledge base         and community forums, and a view of their tickets. However, if your end-users aren't         registered, they don't have access to that view of tickets (they must be logged in). For         these end-users, all communication with the support team is via email. For more information,         see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20032793-setting-up-an-email-only-help-desk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Setting up an email-only help desk<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You also have the option of adding your end-users to an organization, which is a collection         of users (both end-users and agents) that can be used in many ways throughout the help desk         workflow.

The agent's role and privileges in the help desk are defined by admins and may include the following:<a name=\"topic_ibd_fdq_cc__d13e11\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic_ibd_fdq_cc__d13e11\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">May be added to more than one group (must be added to at least one)<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Add end-users<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Add public or private comments or both to tickets<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Create and edit their own macros<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Moderate and manage articles in the forums<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Access tickets in one of the following ways:<a name=\"topic_ibd_fdq_cc__d13e24\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic_ibd_fdq_cc__d13e24\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">All tickets in the help desk<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Only tickets assigned to the group or groups to which they belong<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Only tickets received from the organization to which they belong<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Only tickets that they are assigned to<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Admins can add new agents to the help desk either manually one at a time or as a bulk           import operation (you can set the user role in the CSV data file used in a bulk import).           Agents can be promoted to the admin role by an admin.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Agents are added to groups. Each agent must be added to at least one group.

They add           end-users, agents, and other admins; define the business rules (automations, triggers,           views, etc.); and customize and extend the help desk. Where an agent's primary function is           to interact with end-users and resolve support requests, admins may do that as well as set           up and manage the workflow.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> You may find general references in the documentation or             the user interface to agents being able to do something in the help desk. It's important             to remember that if an agent can do something so can an admin. It's not the other way             round. So, the shorthand of 'agent' may be used at times when the exact implication is             'agent and admin'.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_fjb_ffq_cc\" class=\"topic nested2\"><a name=\"topic_fjb_ffq_cc\"><\/a>\r\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">Account owner<\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">The account owner is a type of admin. The account name is associated with this             person's name, usually the person who created the account. There can only be one account             owner; however, account ownership can be reassigned by the account owner to another             admin if needed. The account owner has access to areas of the help desk that other             admins do not, such as invoicing, payment options, and benchmarking for the account.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_cwu_hbp_cc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_cwu_hbp_cc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">User references in business rules<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<div class=\"p\">Business rules need to refer to some types of users in more abstract ways to define         conditions and actions; therefore, you'll see references in the help desk to           <em>requester<\/em>, <em>assignee<\/em>, <em>current user<\/em>, and <em>non-restricted agent<\/em>. <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">Requester<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Requester refers to the person who made the support request. Requester is used             throughout the help desk (including macros, views, automations, triggers, and reports)             to refer to the person who generated the support request.<\/p>\r\n<\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">Assignee<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Assignee is the agent assigned to a ticket.

The current user (whoever             updated the ticket last) changes whenever the ticket is updated. And, the update may             have been made by the assignee, the requester, or someone who was CC'd on the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<\/dd> <\/dl> <dl class=\"dl\"> <dt class=\"dt dlterm\">Non-restricted agent<\/dt> <dd class=\"dd\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">A non-restricted agent is an agent who has access to all tickets. In other             words, they have not been restricted to only the group or groups to which they belong,             the organization they belong to, or to the tickets they have been assigned to. The             ability to refer to these agents may be useful when creating triggers.<\/p>\r\n<\/dd> <\/dl><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","updated_at":"2011\/04\/27 14:39:17 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":0,"id":20055812,"forum_id":20004391,"submitter_id":28633492,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":699,"created_at":"2011\/04\/06 17:14:55 -0700","title":"Streamlining the help desk workflow","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<!--?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?-->\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/n6hghytvtka4qrh\/?name=zug_watermark.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"zug_watermark.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Managing your customers\u2019 support issues and your help desk workflow requires tools that             help you to create as many process efficiencies as possible. The best way to understand             how Zendesk makes this possible is to look at how a typical helpdesk workflow can be             streamlined with the tools that Zendesk provides.<\/p>\r\n<div id=\"id113ND0H60Y4\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"id113ND0H60Y4\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Ticket handling shortcuts<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">It\u2019s common to get support requests for issues that affect more than one person and                 can be answered with a single, standard response. To do this in Zendesk, you use                         <strong><dfn class=\"term\"><em>macros<\/em><\/dfn><\/strong> to create the standard responses and they are then manually applied to tickets by agents. Macros can also be used to update tickets                 (for any number of reasons) without also notifying the requester. For example,                 macros can change the agent or group assignment.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Here\u2019s an example of a macro that sends an email notification to the requester in                 response to an issue that affects many people in an organization:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"id113ND0H60Y4__image_trw_kta_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/6qmsuxxrtnrbkzu\/?name=macro_intranet.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"macro_intranet.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">This macro adds a public comment to the ticket (which the requester receives in                 email), sets the status to solved, and adds a relevant tag (we\u2019ll discuss tags                 shortly). You could extend this macro to also set the ticket type to incident and                 add a link to the original problem ticket. Using a macro in this situation is much                 quicker than manually responding to everyone who is affected.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">In the text of the comment above, you may have noticed the text contained in the                 double curly brackets. These are called <strong><em>placeholders<\/em><\/strong> and their purpose is to stand                 in for data that will be automatically inserted into the email notification. Without                 placeholders it would be impossible to create automatic notifications. You\u2019d have to                 manually enter this data for each ticket. For more information about placeholders                 and how they are used, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011631-using-placeholders\" target=\"_blank\">Using                     placeholders<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Macros are also used as shortcuts to streamline repetitive ticket handling tasks.                 Here\u2019s an example of a macro that is used by the support staff and does not notify                 the requester:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"id113ND0H60Y4__image_nsv_hva_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/s4nj3paxm9ukdif\/?name=macro_takeit.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"macro_takeit.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The <strong>Take it!<\/strong> macro assigns the ticket that an agent is currently viewing to                 that agent and the agent\u2019s group.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">To see this for yourself, select <strong>Manage &gt; Macros<\/strong> and then select the macro                 called <strong>Take it!<\/strong>. Click <strong>Edit<\/strong> to see the actions contained in the                 macro.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Macros are applied to tickets in ticket editing mode by clicking <strong>Apply Macro<\/strong> and selecting one from the list of active macros.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"id113ND0H60Y4__image_rik_uva_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/cspuluig9tlubib\/?name=macro_apply_menu.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"macro_apply_menu.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can also apply macros to one or more tickets displayed in a view.&nbsp;For more information about creating and using macros, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011363-creating-ticket-handling-shortcuts-with-macros\" target=\"_blank\">Creating ticket handling shortcuts with                     macros<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"id113ND0NF0HS\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"id113ND0NF0HS\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Triggering actions when tickets are created or updated<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">When a ticket is created or updated, you can immediately and automatically respond by                 modifying ticket properties (opening the ticket and assigning an agent, for example)                 and sending email notifications to the requester (confirming that their request has                 been received and that a ticket has been created, for example). The mechanism that                 enables this is called a <strong><em>trigger<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Using triggers, you can also automatically assign a ticket to a specific support                 agent or support group based on the email domain of the ticket requester or keywords                 contained in the request message. Those are just a few examples; triggers can be used in many ways.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">A trigger is a combination of conditions and actions. Conditions define the criteria                 that, if true, trigger the actions. In other words, if all these things about the ticket are true                 then make these changes and, optionally, notify either the customer or the support                 staff. Here\u2019s an example of one of the triggers included in Zendesk:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"id113ND0NF0HS__image_hnv_gwa_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/hfvuxzsettnfmdv\/?name=trigger_notify_requester_new.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"trigger_notify_requester_new.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">To see this for yourself, select <strong>Manage &gt; Triggers and mail notifications <\/strong>and                 then select the trigger called <strong>Notify requester of received request<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The conditions in this trigger require that the ticket is newly created and that the                 status is not solved (a new ticket with no further action taken on it). If those two                 conditions are true, the action sends an email notification to the requester                 informing them that the request has been received and is now a ticket (and they are                 provided with the ticket ID and URL). You can modify the email message as you like                 and, if you're running an email only help desk, you can also remove the ticket URL.                 You can create copies of the default Zendesk triggers or create new triggers as                 needed.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">It's important to note that as new tickets are created or existing tickets are                 updated, Zendesk automatically runs through <em>all<\/em> of your triggers (from first                 to last) checking to see if each trigger\u2019s criteria are met. Whenever the ticket                 matches the conditions, the trigger is fired. This means that what happens in one                 trigger may affect what happens in other triggers.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">For more information about creating and using triggers, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011606-streamlining-workflow-with-ticket-updates-and-triggers\" target=\"_blank\">Streamlining workflow with ticket updates and                     triggers<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"id113ND0S06UI\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"id113ND0S06UI\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Using time to streamline workflow<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">While triggers enable you to automatically act on tickets when they are created or                 updated, you can also modify tickets and send email notifications based on events in time.                 For example, you may want agent groups to be alerted if tickets remain unassigned                 after 24 hours. To do this in Zendesk, you use <strong><dfn class=\"term\"><em>automations<\/em><\/dfn><\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Automations, like triggers, contain conditions and actions, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"id113ND0S06UI__image_ogk_qwa_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/pmzc9ovur8oed6d\/?name=automation_close_4days.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"automation_close_4days.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">To see this for yourself, select <strong>Manage &gt; Automations<\/strong> and then select the                 trigger called <strong>Close ticket 4 days after status is set to solved<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">As the conditions indicate, this automation runs on all tickets that have been set to                 solved for more than 96 hours. The action changes the status from solved to closed.                 If you're curious, 4 days (96 hours) is a help desk best practice for the minimum amount of time&nbsp;a                 ticket should remain in the solved state before it is closed.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Unlike triggers, which are based on ticket events and run immediately after tickets                 are created or updated, automations only run once every hour and only on tickets                 that have been created or updated in the last 28 days.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">For more information about using automations, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20012032-streamlining-workflow-with-time-based-events-and-automations\" target=\"_blank\">Streamlining workflow with time-based events and                     automations<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"id113ND0XL0HT\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"id113ND0XL0HT\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Using ticket events to notify external targets<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">There may be times when you want to notify an external target about a new ticket or                 an important state change to a ticket (for example, send an email or text message                 when a high priority ticket has not been resolved after a specified amount of time).                 By setting up external <strong><dfn class=\"term\"><em>targets<\/em><\/dfn><\/strong> you can communicate with many                 cloud-based applications and services (such as Twitter and Twilio) as well as HTTP                 and email.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Once you\u2019ve defined a target you can add it to automations and triggers.

As a first step, please clear your cache.&nbsp; If the problem persists, change browser.&nbsp; Through the beta program, we had success with the latest version of IE and Safari.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Q: To access SugarCRM, I am required to authenticate with a third-party system (i.e. SAML, LDAP, Gmail login...), does the integration support these setups?<\/h3>\r\n<p>A: No we do not support it natively.&nbsp; However, there is a workaround for user authentication.&nbsp; You need to make sure that the username and login is a SugarCRM one (where the credentials are stored in SugarCRM).&nbsp; The same applies for your Zendesk credentials.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Q: If I create an End User record in Zendesk, does that create a Contact record in Sugar?<\/h3>\r\n<p>A: No, it does not. &nbsp;However, we will use the email address of the new end-user and match it to the right contact in Sugar (if that Contact exists).<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Q: How does Zendesk associate tickets to an SugarCRM account?<\/h3>\r\n<p>A: There is a four-step process to match the right tickets.&nbsp; We process to the next step if the condition for the step has not been satisfied or if no ticket matches the query.<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Is there a non-empty zendesk_organization&nbsp;field associated with the account?&nbsp; If yes, retrieve all tickets which belong to the organization.<\/li>\r\n<li>Has \"Show Account tickets by Zendesk organization\" been selected?&nbsp; If yes, retrieve all tickets for the Zendesk organization that matches that account name.<\/li>\r\n<li>Does the account have any contacts?&nbsp; If yes, retrieve all tickets associated with these contacts.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use the account name as the Zendesk organization name to retrieve tickets.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Q: If I create a Contact or Organization record in SugarCRM, do the corresponding records in Zendesk get created?<\/h3>\r\n<p>A: No, it does not.&nbsp; Generally, we do not automatically create records between the two systems (except for the Ticket-to-Case feature where a contact will get created automatically when the end-user does not exist as a contact in Sugar).<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Q: How do I remove the integration from SugarCRM?<\/h3>\r\n<p>A: You need to go back to your <em>Module Loader<\/em> and make sure that the Zendesk module is completely deleted.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Q: I have an old version of the Zendesk module, how do I install the new Zendesk module?<\/h3>\r\n<p>A: You need to remove the old Zendesk module (i.e. delete the old module) and install the new one fresh.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/06\/08 15:12:51 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":20179256,"forum_id":20004426,"submitter_id":22910460,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":1326,"created_at":"2010\/12\/17 00:21:56 -0800","title":"Putting your dropbox on your Zendesk support site","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["chat","dropbox","instructions","support"],"body":"<p>Since launching Zendesk Chat, we've seen a number of requests for information on how to put your dropbox on your Zendesk support site. &nbsp;There are a few tweaks that go into this process.

Here's how:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Create a DNS entry for your domain. This can be done by anyone who can access your account with the domain name registrar.

Tickets can be created through multiple channels: email, your website, social media, online chat, phone, and more. &nbsp;Wherever these conversations are started, however, they all become tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once the support ticket has been submitted, your goal is to resolve it as quickly and efficiently as possibly, whether it\u2019s a simple question about how your product works, or a major customer problem. &nbsp;In each case, the support conversation goes through a series of stages: the ticket might require your attention or it might be waiting on some information from the customer; eventually, it is resolved.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>In this lesson<\/em>, we are going to submit a support request using email.<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk comes set up to work with email. &nbsp;When you signed up for your Zendesk account, you were given a Zendesk support email address: <a href=\"mailto:support@youraccount.zendesk.com\">support@youraccount.zendesk.com<\/a> where \u201cyouraccount\u201d is the site name you signed up with. &nbsp;You can see your account name in the URL displayed in the address bar\u201d. Sidebar: You can change this email address, which we\u2019ll get to in the next lesson.<\/p>\r\n<p>We\u2019re going to send an email to this address. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Tip: if you are an admin, it\u2019s important that you send any test emails from a different email account than the one you use with your administrator account. &nbsp;Since your Zendesk recognizes your email as the owner of the account it treats you differently than it does one of your customers. &nbsp;In general, it\u2019s good to have a separate email address that you use to test your Zendesk. &nbsp;This gives you the opportunity to experience Zendesk the way your customers will.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Open up your email and send an email as if from a customer to your zendesk support address (i.e. support@youraccount.zendesk.com). &nbsp;Our account is called MondoCam - an international camera company we use for demo purposes. &nbsp;So in our case, we are sending the email to support@mondocam.zendesk.com<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/submitting-your-first-ticket.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image01.png\" width=\"546\" height=\"659\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>You can write whatever you want, but it can be helpful to write something you might actually see from a customer.<\/p>\r\n<p>That\u2019s it! Your first support ticket submitted.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"seeing-and-replying-to-support-tickets\">Seeing and replying to support tickets<\/h2>\r\n<p>Back in our Zendesk account, let\u2019s see where that email ended up. &nbsp;Once a customer sends you a ticket, it will be automatically converted to a ticket and show up in your <strong>Views<\/strong>. &nbsp;To see those, hover over the <strong>View<\/strong> tab in the top navigation.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image03.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"573\" height=\"124\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Views are like custom inboxes for your support tickets. &nbsp;We\u2019ll discuss them more in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041243-lesson-5-working-with-your-whole-team\">Lesson 5<\/a>. &nbsp;The default view is called <strong>My Unsolved Tickets<\/strong>, which shows you any ticket that you haven\u2019t deemed solved yet. &nbsp;The ticket you just sent in will show up here. &nbsp;If you haven\u2019t already, click on My Unsolved Tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image09.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"569\" height=\"229\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>There it is! &nbsp;Nice. &nbsp;Click the title of the ticket to open it. &nbsp;The ticket is where you respond to the customer; but the ticket will also keep a log of all the subsequent communication between your team and the customer. &nbsp;Let\u2019s go ahead and respond to this ticket now.<\/p>\r\n<p>We want to ask the customer for more information. &nbsp;To do that, add a comment below the initial one asking for more information. &nbsp; Simply type your response in the text box.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next we\u2019ll change the drop-down fields on the ticket labeled <strong>Status<\/strong>, <strong>Type<\/strong> and <strong>Priority<\/strong>. &nbsp;Zendesk can add and keep track of a support conversation\u2019s details by setting these drop-down fields, or as they are called in Zendesk, <strong>Ticket Fields<\/strong>. &nbsp;You can modify these ticket fields as well as add your own. &nbsp;We go over that in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041243-lesson-5-working-with-your-whole-team\">Lesson 5<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The status field says \u201copen\u201d. &nbsp;A Zendesk ticket can have five statuses, each of which marks a different stage along the path from a customer submitting a request to your agents solving it.<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> <strong>New<\/strong> - a ticket that has just come in and hasn\u2019t been opened yet. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Open<\/strong> - a ticket that has been opened and requires attention. &nbsp;Open tickets are the ones that are currently on your plate. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Pending<\/strong> - a ticket that is waiting on another party, usually the customer. &nbsp;Use this for when you are waiting on a customer reply. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Solved<\/strong> - means the ticket has been deemed resolved. &nbsp;Can still be re-opened however. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Closed<\/strong> - once a ticket has been solved for a number of days, it is officially (and automatically) closed. Closed tickets are archived and cannot be reopened. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>We are asking the customer to send us more information, so change the status of the ticket to pending. &nbsp;By changing the status, we help ourselves organize our tickets into ones that require attention and those that we can\u2019t work on at the moment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, the <strong>Type<\/strong> drop-down field. &nbsp;Like status, there a number of ticket types. &nbsp;The type describes what kind of issue you are dealing with. &nbsp;There are four ticket types; and depending on which you choose, you get a different set of features.<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> <strong>Question<\/strong> - the most basic type; for when a customer has a question about your business or service. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Problem<\/strong> - for when a customer has a problem with your business or service <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Incident<\/strong> - are specific instances of problems. &nbsp;For instance: if the problem is that our billing system is down, each ticket that comes in after we identify the problem is an incident of the problem. &nbsp;This lets us group our tickets together around a common issue. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Task<\/strong> - are for tickets which turn into a to-do item for your agents. &nbsp;They can have a due date. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>Because the customer is asking a question about our product, we will change the Type field to Question. &nbsp;We might change that later as we gather more information. &nbsp;Lastly, because we aren\u2019t sure exactly what is going on yet, let\u2019s set <strong>Priority<\/strong> to normal. You could also choose Low, High, and Urgent. &nbsp;Priority is another ticket categorization tool. &nbsp;When we look at ticket organization in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041188-lesson-4-improving-your-views\">Lesson 4<\/a>, we will see how you can use priority to focus on your highest priority tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ok, your ticket should look something like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image08.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"563\" height=\"521\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>We are now ready to reply to the customer. &nbsp;To do so, click the submit button under your comment. &nbsp;This will update the ticket with all the changes we just made and send out our reply to the customer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk returns you to your Unsolved Ticket View with a message that you\u2019ve updated your ticket.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"what-your-customer-sees\">What Your Customer Sees<\/h2>\r\n<p>When you click submit, Zendesk sends out your comment to the customer. &nbsp;Let\u2019s see what this looks like. &nbsp;We\u2019ll check the email account we used to send in the test support request.<\/p>\r\n<p>You will see two replies:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Your Request has been Received <\/li>\r\n<li>An update with the comment you just added. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>These replies were automatically sent out by your Zendesk through something called a <strong>Trigger<\/strong>. &nbsp;Triggers are automatic actions that occur when tickets are created or updated. &nbsp;They act like this: \u201cif A happens then do B\u201d. &nbsp;So for instance:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When a customer submits a ticket <\/li>\r\n<li>Zendesk automatically replies and acknowledges that the request has been received. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>That\u2019s where that first email came from.<\/p>\r\n<p>But a trigger also sent out our second email:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When you make a comment on a ticket <\/li>\r\n<li>Zendesk automatically sends that comment back to the customer. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The subject line of the second email should read something like \u201c[MondoCam] Re: Problems using the XR50-HyperShot\u201d. Click into that email.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image06.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"407\" height=\"551\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>It has both your comment and the original request for support. &nbsp;There is also a link back to the ticket. &nbsp;All of this is controlled by the trigger that sent it out. &nbsp;Triggers are a powerful tool in Zendesk and we\u2019ll go through them at length in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041243-lesson-5-working-with-your-whole-team\">Lesson 5<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"how-your-customer-replies\">How Your Customer Replies<\/h2>\r\n<p>How does your customer respond? &nbsp;As the email says, \u201cYou can add a comment by replying to this email\u201d. &nbsp;Let\u2019s try it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Hit reply and type out a response from the customer perspective. &nbsp;In our example we asked for the customer to attach an image. &nbsp;Go ahead and try this as well, attach an image to your email and click send.<\/p>\r\n<p>Go back to your Zendesk and return to the My Unsolved Ticket view (click the View tab to get there). &nbsp;There\u2019s your ticket, with the customer reply showing. &nbsp;Notice too that ticket status has changed from Pending to Open.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image00.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"579\" height=\"127\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Since the customer replied, you are no longer waiting on them. &nbsp;This reopens the ticket and puts it back on your plate.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"solving-a-ticket\">Solving A Ticket<\/h2>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s resolve this issue now. &nbsp;Click in to the ticket. &nbsp;There is the customer response along with the image we attached - cool! You can click quick view to see your image right from within the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now we have enough information to solve this ticket. &nbsp;We will respond with the answer to their question; and we can change the status to Solved in the drop-down menu. &nbsp;Your ticket should look something like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that we can also attach files to tickets. &nbsp;Just click the <strong>Attach<\/strong> file link in the lower right of the comment box. &nbsp;Once we are satisfied that we have successfully trouble-shot the customer\u2019s issue and answered their question, we can hit submit.<\/p>\r\n<p>Easy as that! &nbsp;We just solved our first ticket. &nbsp;Your Zendesk even tracks your weekly progress by telling you how many tickets you\u2019ve solved (see screenshot below) .<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image04.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"574\" height=\"57\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"reviewing-a-tickets-history\">Reviewing a Ticket\u2019s History<\/h2>\r\n<p>We just went through a pretty typical support interaction in Zendesk. &nbsp;A customer contacted us with a question; we troubleshot the issue; and ultimately answered their question. &nbsp;But Zendesk not only helps us to resolve the issues; it keeps a history of all the activity. Let\u2019s review the ticket history.<\/p>\r\n<p>To return to our ticket, click the <strong>Recent<\/strong> tab in the top menu bar. &nbsp;This gives you quick access to any tickets you handled recently.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now in the ticket, click the <strong>All Events and Notifications<\/strong> link. &nbsp;It is in the top right of the <strong>Comments<\/strong> section.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image02.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"544\" height=\"113\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This shows us every change that occurred on our ticket. &nbsp;You can see the changes we made manually like changing the Type to Question; as well as the automatic actions taken by Zendesk - such as the Trigger that sent out the Notification Emails when we added new comments, as well as when the customer replied and the ticket went from Pending to Open.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/image07.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"605\" height=\"484\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Notice too that a notification was sent out when we solved the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h2>\r\n<p>In this lesson, we jumped right into the support process with Zendesk. &nbsp;We saw how Zendesk receives support requests through email and turns them into tickets. &nbsp;And then we went through the basic steps you take to resolve that request within Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now that we have the basics down we can start to take advantage of some of Zendesk\u2019s other features and tools. &nbsp;In addition to email, for instance, Zendesk can receive support requests from multiple channels, including web site forms, live online chat, and Twitter.<\/p>\r\n<p>We\u2019ll also be diving into Triggers more to see how they can automate and accelerate a lot of your support tasks; and discuss how you can organize your customers and agents into groups.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Next Lesson: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041068-lesson-2-customizing-the-agent-homepage\">Customizing the Agent Homepage<\/a> \u2192<\/h4>","updated_at":"2011\/06\/01 09:50:13 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":0,"id":20040818,"forum_id":20025588,"submitter_id":2851201,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":2,"is_locked":false,"hits":1103,"created_at":"2011\/04\/19 16:19:58 -0700","title":"Lesson 2: Customizing the Agent Homepage","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["getting-started","web-portal"],"body":"<p>In this lesson, we\u2019re going to go over and customize what you see when you first log in to Zendesk. If you just created your account, you will initially see the Getting Started Screen (see picture below).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/getting-started-page.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"553\" height=\"657\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>However, on your subsequent logins you will be directed to your <strong>Web Portal Home Page<\/strong>. (You can also always get there by clicking the Home tab in the menu bar bar.) For new accounts, that screen looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/web-portal-homepage-areas.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"622\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>We\u2019ll show you ways to change the information on this page as well as customize the look of it. Your agents and you will be spending a lot of time working in this web portal, so it makes sense to get to know the interface, as well as how to get your content in there, and integrate the look of it with your company\u2019s look.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are five main areas to your support homepage:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Header and menu bar <\/li>\r\n<li> Introductory Text <\/li>\r\n<li> Highlighted Forum Articles <\/li>\r\n<li> The Forum directory <\/li>\r\n<li> The sidebar <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h2 id=\"header-and-menu-bar\">Header and menu bar<\/h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/zendesk-default-menu-bar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"56\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Your account name is in the upper left of the header along with a Zendesk logo. Links to your personal profile and to Zendesk\u2019s help are in the upper right. The menu bar of your web portal goes across the bottom of the header.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"adding-your-logo-and-colors\">Adding your logo and colors<\/h3>\r\n<p>Zendesk offers some simple web tools to change the colors and add your own logo. Anyone can use them, you don\u2019t need to be a programmer or designer. NOTE: there are some advanced customization options as well, which we will look at in the next lesson.<\/p>\r\n<p>While the Zendesk logo is nice, let\u2019s swap it out with our own logo.<\/p>\r\n<p>All the basic personalization tools are in <strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Branding<\/strong>. Go there and scroll to the bottom until you see Header logo.<\/p>\r\n<p>Adding a logo is as simple as uploading it here, but it\u2019s important to note that Zendesk will resize the logo to 50px by 50px, so it\u2019s best to make sure you have a version of your logo optimized for that size.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you have a version of your logo that looks good at that size, click the choose file button and browse to it from your computer. It is fine if the image is larger than 50px by 50px - but Zendesk will scale it to fit within that space.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/uploading-a-new-logo-to-zendesk.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"614\" height=\"171\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>When you choose a new logo, you can also indicate a URL to which you want the logo to link. It makes sense to add your own website.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click <strong>Save Changes<\/strong> on the bottom of the page and you have a new logo.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/your-new-logo-on-zendesk.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"385\" height=\"106\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"changing-the-colors\">Changing the Colors<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now, unless you happen to have the exact same color scheme as Zendesk, your logo probably looks a little funny up there. Let\u2019s change the colors to fit our brand and work with the logo better.<\/p>\r\n<p>You should still be in the <strong>Personalize Your Zendesk<\/strong> page. Scroll to the section labeled Help desk colors. Click on the green bar next to page Page header. Up pops a color picker tool.<\/p>\r\n<p>We can either choose the color using the color picker (the round dot on the color block) or by entering in the hex number for the color.<\/p>\r\n<p><em><span class=\"c2 c13\">TIP: hex numbers are a computer standard code for describing colors.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/changing-colors-on-zendesk.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"682\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>We are going to enter the hex number for our brand color - which is a deep blue - #002262.

This is how you will navigate your support site.<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> <strong>Home<\/strong> - brings you back to the support homepage <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Forums<\/strong> - your knowledge base and community support <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Manage<\/strong> - a menu where you manage the pieces of your help desk including users, work flows, and pre-built responses. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Settings<\/strong> - a menu with administrative and ownership control, including branding tools and tools that integrate your Zendesk with other tools. (Note that you\u2019ll only see the Account menu if you\u2019re an administrator. Individual support agents will not have access to these settings.) <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Twitter icon<\/strong> - Zendesk allows you to monitor and respond to support requests that come through Twitter. This tab gives you direct access to that feature. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Views<\/strong> - The customizable collection buckets for all your support requests. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>+ New<\/strong>- Takes you directly to a new support ticket. <\/li>\r\n<li> <strong>Search Ba<\/strong>r - searches your entire support history, including knowledge base and tickets.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The Manage and Account tabs have a number of related sub menus.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"hiding-the-introductory-text\">Hiding the Introductory Text<\/h3>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the other sections of your web portal home page and make a few changes to get you started.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/zendesk-intro-message.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"608\" height=\"85\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The Introductory Text is the section right below the menu bar. It is completely editable and a good place to put a welcome message or other information about your support -- hours, contact information, etc. The introductory text comes more into play when we start to configure the web portal for our customers\u2019 use, so let\u2019s hide it for now.<\/p>\r\n<p>To hide it, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Channels<\/strong> and then click the green edit link next to <strong>Web Portal<\/strong>.  This page has a number of settings for your web portal content - what is shown and how it is displayed. To hide the introductory text, uncheck the <strong>show<\/strong> box on the first item and click the save button at the bottom of the page.<\/p>\r\n<p>The remaining settings all address your Zendesk <strong>Forums<\/strong>. You can use forums to build out a knowledge base and FAQ section, as well as to offer community support, creating a space for your customers to ask public questions and engage with other customers.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/zendesk-web-portal-channel.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"622\" height=\"884\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>As you see, you can choose to show your forums on your home page. Let\u2019s return there to see what they look like. Click on the Home tab in the menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"adding-a-knowledge-base-to-your-web-portal-home-page\">Adding a Knowledge Base to Your Web Portal Home Page<\/h2>\r\n<p>The forums occupy the bulk of your home page. <strong>Forums<\/strong> are collections of articles and\/or community questions and feedback. Each entry in a forum is called a topic. One great way to utilize that is to add a knowledge base and start building up some documentation on your product or service. This can be helpful for your support agents as they are troubleshooting a customer\u2019s questions. It centralizes your support knowledge in one place and integrates it with your ticketing system.<\/p>\r\n<p>To start building a knowledge base we are going to explore the forums, add some new content relevant to our business, and display that on our web portal home page.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you first sign up for your Zendesk account, you are set up with a few example forums -- Announcements, Community Help, Tips &amp; Tricks, Feature Requests, and Agents Only.  If these sample forums work for you, you can definitely start adding content to them.<\/p>\r\n<p>For our knowledge base example, let\u2019s customize the forums so that they are organized around our product line. We want to group articles around each product we manufacture to make it very easy to browse. To do that we are going to create separate forums for each product line and then group them into a forum category called Knowledge Base. Lastly, we\u2019ll configure how it displays on the home page.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"creating-new-forums\">Creating new forums<\/h3>\r\n<p>To create a new forum around a product line, we will go to the Forums page on our Zendesk. Click the <strong>Forum<\/strong> tab in the menu bar. It looks very similar to what we had on our home page. But while the forums can be displayed on the home page, all forum organization and configuration happens here. Notice the green actions link on the right side of the page, which were not available on the home page.<\/p>\r\n<p>Add a new forum by clicking the actions link and choosing add forum.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/add-forum-to-category.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"681\" height=\"218\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Add a title of a product line. We\u2019ll call our \"Digital Compact Cameras\", one of MondoCam\u2019s product lines. Add a description of the product line in the description field - this will be displayed along with the forum and can provide some general information about the product. Leave everything else as is. These options become useful later when building out an area for customer community support. For now we are focusing on knowledge base articles and the defaults work well for that. For more on community support and forum options, check out the <span class=\"c15 c17\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/176227-community-support-and-knowledge-base-sharing\">community support video tutorial<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/adding-a-new-forum-edit-screen.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"617\" height=\"605\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Click the <strong>Add Forum<\/strong> button at the end of the forum. This takes us into our new forum. The title we just added is across the top, along with some breadcrumb style navigation (you can click <strong>Forums<\/strong> to go back up one level); a search bar allows us to search within that forum (not that interesting yet as we have no content); when we add forum topics, they will be listed in the main column; and the description we wrote is in the right column.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/forum-page.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"617\" height=\"286\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s add a knowledge base article about this particular product line (\u201cdigital compact cameras\u201d in our MondoCam example). Click the <strong>Add Article<\/strong> button on the right side.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the next page, you create your knowledge base article by adding a title and the article body. For our example, we are going to add a question a customer might ask about our product line. This will help our agents troubleshoot customer questions.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can either write something from scratch, or if you have an existing knowledge base, simply copy and paste an article into the text box (you can paste in text as well as images). Notice the drop-down titled <strong>Which forum does this topic belong to?<\/strong>It has our new forum selected, but you could change it to another forum.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lastly, we can set a few options for how this topic is displayed. We don\u2019t want people to leave comments on our knowledge base articles -- we\u2019d rather have them submit a support ticket if they have questions -- so let\u2019s check the disable comments box. Leave the other items unchecked for now. Your form should look something like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/adding-a-forum-topic.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"620\" height=\"637\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Looks good. Click <strong>update<\/strong> in the bottom right of the form. This brings us to the forum topic as people will see it when they browse to it. If you need to ever make a change to your documentation -- when a product is updated for instance -- you can edit it at any point by clicking the green edit link in the upper right of the article.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ok, remember that we were adding a knowledge base article to display on our web portal home page. Let\u2019s go back there and see what it looks like. Click the home tab in the menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p>Looks ok - there\u2019s our forum along with the sample forums Zendesk starts you off with; and the article we just added is listed.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/forums-on-the-home-page.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"613\" height=\"681\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>But it could look even more organized. And some of those sample forums don\u2019t apply to our business. To clean up how this looks, and make it much easier to browse for our agents, we can create a forum <strong>Category<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to grouping related topics together in forums, you can group related forums into categories. Let\u2019s create a category called Knowledge Base and move our product forum into it.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"create-a-forum-category\">Create a Forum Category<\/h3>\r\n<p>Creating a forum category is very similar to creating a forum itself. First, as we did before, we need to go the <strong>Forums<\/strong> tab in the menu bar. On the forum management page, click the <strong>Add Category<\/strong> button in the upper right of the main column. On the new category page add a title and a description. The title will be displayed on the home page as a section heading (see picture below)<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/adding-a-category.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"619\" height=\"577\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>We\u2019ll title ours \u201cKnowledge Base\u201d and add a simple description: \u201cOfficial Articles, Manuals, and Tips about all of MondoCam's products\u201d. When you click Update, you\u2019ll see your category on your Forum Management page. Let\u2019s see how it looks on the home page. Click the <strong>Home<\/strong> tab.<\/p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s gone! What gives? It turns out that Zendesk will not display a forum category if it doesn\u2019t have any forums in it. We need to move our product forum into the Knowledge Base category and then it will show up on our home page.<\/p>\r\n<p>To move the forum category you created earlier, click the title of the forum; and then click the green edit link on the forum page. You\u2019ll now notice a drop-down titled \u201cWhich category does this forum belong to?\u201d open that up and choose \u201cKnowledge Base\u201d (or whatever you named the category you created).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/choosing-a-forum-category.png\" style=\"border: 0px initial initial;\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Click the <strong>update forum<\/strong> button.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now when you go to the home page your category shows up with your forum within it.<\/p>\r\n<p>How are we doing? Our web portal home page is definitely taking shape. It sports our logo and colors, and we are starting to build up a knowledge base for our agents to access. From here, you can continue to organize and add articles to your knowledge base.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"pinned-forums-topics\">Pinned Forum Topics (and how to unpin them)<\/h3>\r\n<p>There\u2019s one last item on the home page we haven\u2019t looked at yet. The message titled \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/pinned-forum-topic.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"615\" height=\"171\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>It reads:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>This topic was posted to the restricted Agents Only forum in your help desk and pinned to the home page. The topic is visible to help desk agents only, not your customers.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>This points to an aspect of the web portal home page and of forums that we haven\u2019t considered yet: what can your customers see? We are going to look at that in the next section.<\/p>\r\n<p>For now, let\u2019s focus on the other piece introduced by this post: the idea of pinning topics to the homepage. It turns out that this \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d post is a normal forum topic. You may remember from earlier in the lesson a set of options for how a forum topic is to be displayed (see below).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/forum-topic-options.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"484\" height=\"126\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>One of those options was to pin a topic to the home page. When you enable this option, it shows up on your home page just like this \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d post. This gives you the ability to showcase particular content that could be useful for your support agents.<\/p>\r\n<p>And when that content is no longer useful -- perhaps you want to highlight a product update, but only for a week -- you can unpin it. Now that we have read the \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d post, it isn\u2019t really something we need to see every time we log in.<\/p>\r\n<p>To unpin it, all we have to do is click the unpin link under the title.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/unpinning-a-forum-topic.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"519\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>It disappears, but note that it hasn\u2019t been deleted. You can still see it listed in the \u201cAgents Only\u201d forum in the Forum Directory on the home page.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>TIP: To re-pin something, go into the topic and click the green edit link the upper right of the main column. Select the checkbox at the bottom titled \u201cPin to Home Page\u201d and update the post.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h2>\r\n<p>In this lesson, we customized the agent home page to look more in line with your company\u2019s brand. And we started building a knowledge base that your agents can use when troubleshooting customer questions. We looked at how the Zendesk forums are organized, with topics, forums, and categories; and saw how to move items between forums and categories. Lastly, we saw that we could highlight particular forum topics by pinning them to our web portal home page.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/homepage-with-no-pinned-topics.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"608\" height=\"470\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>In the next lesson, we\u2019ll return to setting up Zendesk for your customers point of view. We\u2019ll set up your web portal for their use so you can communicate important news and announcements to them; so they can help themselves to your public knowledge base; and so they submit tickets and keep track of their support history. We\u2019ll also make the support experience more seamless for them by removing the word Zendesk from your support email and your web portal URL.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Next Lesson: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041133-lesson-3-customizing-the-customer-experience\">Customizing the Customer Experience \u2192<\/a><\/h4>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/19 09:29:49 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":2,"posts_count":0,"id":20041068,"forum_id":20025588,"submitter_id":2851201,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":3,"is_locked":false,"hits":1210,"created_at":"2011\/04\/19 16:37:37 -0700","title":"Lesson 3: Customizing the customer experience","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["getting-started","web-portal"],"body":"<p>So far, we\u2019ve been working on the web portal home page you see when you log in to Zendesk. What do your customers or colleagues see when they visit the site?<\/p>\r\n<p>You\u2019ve probably seen it already if you have logged out and then come back to your Zendesk. It looks similar to the home page you see when you log in, but optimized for your customer. The navigation is different and anything that is marked for logged in agents and admins is hidden.<\/p>\r\n<p>The important concept here is that your web portal home page serves both your support team and your customers. Keep that in mind as you are pinning topics to your homepage, writing your introductory text and building out your forums. It is a best practice to run through your own support experience from the customer perspective to ensure it offers the kind of support you want to offer.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this lesson, we are going to review our web portal home page as our customers see it and adjust the content to provide the optimal experience. We will also customize the URL of our Zendesk support site so it can match your business URL. It is important that the support experience you provide your customers feels integrated with the rest of your customer experience. The URL is part of that. Additionally, we will also remove the \u201c.zendesk\u201d from the support email address for both incoming and outgoing messages so that your customers can send email directly to <a href=\"mailto:support@mondocam.com\">support@mondocam.com<\/a> rather than requiring <a href=\"mailto:support@mondocam.zendesk.com\">support@mondocam.zendesk.com<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"assuming-a-customer-perspective\">Assuming a Customer Perspective<\/h2>\r\n<p>In order to see what your customers see on the home page, you can simply log out - but this gets tedious over time. You don\u2019t want to keep logging out and logging back in just to see what your customer sees while you\u2019re working on your support page. A better, quicker way to work on your web portal is to assume the identity of a customer while still logged in to your Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Zendesk, you can assume the identity of any user of your support system. This means experiencing your help desk from their perspective. This can be helpful to guarantee that the system looks and behaves as you want it to for each person.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 1<\/h4>\r\n<p>Click on the <strong>Manage<\/strong> tab in the top navigation and choose <strong>People<\/strong>. If you just created your account you don\u2019t have many users yet, but everyone that has interacted with your help desk so far is in here. (We\u2019ll go over the People section in more detail in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041243-lesson-5-working-with-your-whole-team\">Lesson 5<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>If you are the person who created the account, you should see yourself in the list as <strong>Owner<\/strong>. There is also the test user with the email address from which we sent in a ticket in Lesson 1. (You might also have Kelly H in there, who is a Zendesk employee who has sent you a ticket to help you get started.)<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 2<\/h4>\r\n<p>To assume a user, you can either hover over their name in the user list and click the <strong>assume<\/strong> link that appears; or you can click the <strong>assume an anonymous user link<\/strong> the right column. An anonymous user is one who comes to your web portal and does not log in.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Tip: Once a customer sends in a support ticket, they have the option to create a password for themselves and log in. This will give them access to their support history -- every ticket they sent in -- as well as allow them to participate in your forums. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s review the website from an anonymous user. Click the link the right column.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/assuming-an-anonymous-user.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"616\" height=\"411\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This drops you back on to your home page - it looks similar to what we were looking at earlier in the lesson, but notice the small differences:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> The menu bar is different. <\/li>\r\n<li> You do not see the \"Agents Only Forum\"<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/customer-perspective-menu-bar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"617\" height=\"71\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The menu bar has some new items. Your customers can visit your forums, but instead of having the Manage and Settings tab, they have tabs for submitting new support tickets and for checking support tickets they have submitted in the past.<\/p>\r\n<p>As for the rest of the page, it has the forum directory we were working on in the last lesson, including our Knowledge Base with our new product line forum. It does not, however, have the \u201cAgents Only\u201d forum. As we read in the \u201cFor Your Eyes\u201d only topic in the last lesson, you can create forums and restrict access to them, allowing only your support agents to see the topics within them.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/forums-customer-perspective.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"623\" height=\"331\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The customer web portal home page does show the other sample forums that Zendesk starts us off with. While Zendesk sets you up with a number of items and tools to help you get started, it\u2019s best practice to remove items you aren\u2019t using once you get the hang of things. This will make your Zendesk much easier to use for your agents; they will not have to wade through items irrelevant to them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve started building out and organizing our knowledge base, let\u2019s clear out content we aren\u2019t using. Look through the forums that Zendesk starts you with and decide if you want to use any of them. It\u2019s not a big deal if you remove them and decide to add them back in later. You saw how simple it was to add a new forum earlier. You can always add forums later.<\/p>\r\n<p>For our example, let\u2019s keep \u201cAnnouncements\u201d. We sometimes have announcements about new products or news updates that we want to share.<\/p>\r\n<p>To remove the unused forums, we need to switch back to our administrator profile. To do so, click the <strong>revert<\/strong> <strong>identity<\/strong> link in the upper right. This will bring you back to the <strong>People<\/strong> page.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"configuring-the-customer-web-portal\">Configuring the Customer Web Portal Home Page<\/h2>\r\n<h3 id=\"removing-unused-forums\">Removing Unused Forums<\/h3>\r\n<p>Back in the admin view, let\u2019s remove the forums we aren\u2019t going to use. To do so, click on the <strong>Forum<\/strong> tab. Once there, click on one of the forums you are going to remove -- \u201cCommunity Help\u201d for instance. Now click the green edit link in the upper right of the main column. At the bottom of the page, there is a delete link.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/delete-a-forum.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"584\" height=\"169\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Click that and confirm your choice when the alert pops up.<\/p>\r\n<p>Done! Easy. Now repeat those steps to remove other forums you don\u2019t plan on using. For this example, we are going to keep the \u201cAnnouncements\u201d forum and the \u201cAgents Only\u201d forum. We want to keep some documentation private to our internal staff. We don\u2019t like the name \u201cAgents Only\u201d however. Let\u2019s call it \u201cInternal Documentation\u201d. To make that change click the title of the forum and click the edit link as you did in the previous steps. Rather than delete the forum, however, just change the title.<\/p>\r\n<p>Before you click the Update button, notice the the radio button at the bottom of the form that sets the permissions for who can view topics in this forum.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/forum-permissions.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"368\" height=\"69\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cAgents only\u201d. That\u2019s how you restrict your forums and make them invisible to your customers. Leave that as is and click the update button.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"adding-the-introductory-text-back-in\">Adding The Introductory Text Back In<\/h3>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s make one more change to the customer web portal home page - add back the Introductory Text we removed in the previous lesson. Now that we\u2019ve seen what the customer sees when they visit our web portal, it makes sense to have some text that welcomes and orients them to the site.<\/p>\r\n<p>To show that text, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Channels<\/strong> and then click the edit link next to the <strong>Web Portal<\/strong> section. Click the <strong>Show<\/strong> box in the <strong>Introductory text on portal home page<\/strong> section (the first item). Click the Save button at the bottom of the page; and then check to make sure it is there by clicking the <strong>Home<\/strong> tab in the menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p>There it is! Feel free to edit this however you like, keeping in mind that the introductory text is visible to your customers. To make edits, click the green edit link in the upper right. You can of course keep the default text that Zendesk starts you off with, a generic welcome message.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you have the text as you want it, check to see how everything looks by following the steps earlier in the lesson and assuming an anonymous user.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/default-zendesk-support-address.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"612\" height=\"406\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Looking good, but there are two pieces that might confuse our customers - the Zendesk support email address in the introductory text and the Zendesk in the URL. As we are making the web portal fit more and more with our company, let\u2019s also extend that to email address our customers use to send in support requests, and the URL they visit.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"using-your-organizations-email-address-and-url\">Using Your Organization\u2019s Email Address and URL<\/h2>\r\n<p>Using your own email domain with your Zendesk is easy to do and well worth it. Customers respond better when they see that their question or problem is being handled directly by the company. While you could use the default support address that Zendesk provides you upon sign up, it can sometimes be confusing to a customer when they see another company in the address. \u201cAm I writing to the right company?\u201d they may wonder.<\/p>\r\n<p>So let\u2019s set it up so that your customers write to and receive emails from simply: support@yourcompany.com. (In our case, that will be support@mondocameras.com.)<\/p>\r\n<p>Part of this happens on your end with your email server (whether it\u2019s Google Apps, an MS Exchange server, or some other system your organization uses for managing your email account). Because of that, we will give general instructions easy to follow for whoever administrates the organization\u2019s email.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"receiving-support-emails-at-your-organizations-email-address\">Receiving Support Emails at Your Organization\u2019s Email Address<\/h3>\r\n<p>As we showed earlier, it\u2019s quite simple to get mail into your Zendesk. Just send an email to the Zendesk support email you received upon signing up. Using your own support email address is almost as easy.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you don\u2019t have an email address that you use for support already, the first step is to create one. This is something usually handled by whoever administers the email for your organization. It can be whatever you want: support@yourcompany.com; help@yourcompany.com; info@... you get the idea.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you have created the address, or if you already have an email address you use for support (say: support@yourcompany.com), simply set it up to forward any mail it receives to your default Zendesk address (support@youraccount.zendesk.com). That\u2019s it! The customer will email your address which will send it on to your Zendesk address behind the scenes. They\u2019ve never see the Zendesk name in the email.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/diagram-emailing-your-zendesk.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"604\" height=\"170\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><em>IMPORTANT: if you currently have a support email that you receive support emails to, do not forward that address to your Zendesk until you are ready to start using Zendesk for your real support. Those emails will start coming into your Zendesk as soon as you set up the forward. Better to stick with the default Zendesk email address for testing and set up.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Email forwarding is generally a simple process based on a rule engine in your mail server. You say: when a mail comes into address a, send it to b.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"sending-support-emails-from-your-organizations-email-address\">Sending Support Emails from Your Organization\u2019s Email Address<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now that you can receive emails using your own email address, let\u2019s make sure that your customers also receive all your support responses from that same address (as opposed to receiving email from the <a href=\"mailto:support@youraccount.zendesk.com\">support@<\/a><a href=\"mailto:support@youraccount.zendesk.com\">youraccount.<\/a><a href=\"mailto:support@youraccount.zendesk.com\">zendesk.com<\/a> address). This is not entirely necessary - the whole communication back and forth will continue to work even if you don\u2019t set this up - but it might be confusing for customers who email one address and then receive a response from a separate address.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/diagram-using-your-own-support-email-address.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"604\" height=\"175\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>To set this up, go to the <strong>Account<\/strong> tab and choose the <strong>Mails and Domains<\/strong> page. Find the section labeled <strong>Default reply email address<\/strong>. Unless you\u2019ve already changed it, you should see that default Zendesk support email address you got when you signed up.<\/p>\r\n<p>Replace that with your own email address (we recommend using the same one you set up to forward mails into your Zendesk, e.g <a href=\"mailto:support@mondocam.com\">support@mondocam.com<\/a> in our example). Click <strong>Save changes<\/strong> at the bottom of the page.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, that will work in most cases, but to ensure your mail from Zendesk is delivered correctly, you should also set up what\u2019s called an SPF record with your domain registrar (e.g Godaddy, Network Solutions, Hover, etc.). Essentially what\u2019s happening here is that Zendesk is sending out mail which it is then saying is from your email address. This is fine, and the SPF record basically tells the computer that receive emails delivered this way that it\u2019s all right for Zendesk to send mail under your email address. If you don\u2019t do this, there is a chance your emails may be flagged as spam.<\/p>\r\n<p>We explain how to set up this SPF record in our support forums: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.zendesk.com%2Fentries%2F8051&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtJ_e8TYnRVLbQ74-Q0Ntm0RQuHw\">https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/8051<\/a>. It is a bit technical -- if you have someone who manages your web site, they would be the ones to talk to about this -- but the place you registered your domain name should have some good documentation on how to do it as well.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"using-your-own-domain-name\">Using Your Own Domain Name<\/h3>\r\n<p>Ok! We\u2019ve changed colors and logos, and set it up so that all email communication comes from your own domain name. Lastly, we\u2019ll remove the \u201c.zendesk\u201d from your support site URL so you can use your own domain name; so, for instance, instead of typing mondocam.zendesk.com your support site would be at support.mondocam.com.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is also a bit technical and will require more work at your domain registrar. Essentially, what we need to do is go to the place where your domain name is registered, create a special address, and say that whenever a person goes to that address, show them your Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>You will be creating a subdomain of your website, meaning something like: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.yourwebsite.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGggOL4YRmPkPjF_qCUwvBg8r_S2g\">support.yourwebsite.com<\/a> or help.yourwebsite.com, where \u2018support\u2019 and \u2018help\u2019 are the subdomains in that example (though, your subdomain can be whatever you want).<\/p>\r\n<h4>Step 1<\/h4>\r\n<p>Create a CNAME record within your DNS settings. That\u2019s a lot of acronyms we know, but your domain registrar or the person who manages your website should be able to set it up. We\u2019ve written up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.zendesk.com%2Fentries%2F13976-mapping-a-host-name-of-your-own-to-zendesk-using-cname&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMPPlTUMsJhAh1iidHnyRo_ESNHw\">an example with Godaddy<\/a> in our support forums. The important part is that you point your subdomain (sometimes called a hostname or an alias) at your default Zendesk account address (which is the address in the URL when you first create your account).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/create-a-cname-record.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"542\" height=\"190\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h4>Step 2<\/h4>\r\n<p>Once this is created, you can go back to your Zendesk and to the <strong>Mails and Domains<\/strong> page under the <strong>Account<\/strong> tab. Find the section labeled <strong>Host Mapping<\/strong> and enter the entire URL you created with your CNAME record. In the example above it would be support.mondocameras.com<\/p>\r\n<p>Click <strong>Save Changes<\/strong> and now your new support site is on your domain name. Congratulations!<\/p>\r\n<p><em>TIP: It is very important that you create the CNAME record first because if that is not in place when you put your new URL in the Host Mapping box, you will be unable to reach your support site home page. If this does happen to you, you can always go to <span class=\"c5 c6\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fyouraccount.zendesk.com%2Faccess%2Fnormal&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBjtieTEnoYxlXyPoyf3xYPBhHnQ\">youraccount.zendesk.com\/access\/normal<\/a> which will bring you to your home page no matter what happens.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h2>\r\n<p>In this lesson we went over how to make your Zendesk a part of your organizations overall look, feel, and identity by changing the logo and colors to match your branding; as well as using your name and hiding the Zendesk one so your customers don\u2019t see the Zendesk name while interacting with your support.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Next Lesson: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041188-lesson-4-improving-your-views\">Improving Your Views \u2192<\/a><\/h4>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/19 09:30:55 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":3,"posts_count":0,"id":20041133,"forum_id":20025588,"submitter_id":2851201,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":4,"is_locked":false,"hits":662,"created_at":"2011\/04\/19 16:47:22 -0700","title":"Lesson 4: Improving Your Views","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["getting-started","views"],"body":"<p>Once support requests start coming into your system, you need to organize them into groups that make working with them easier. If you had one support request a day, organization is not that important; but once you start getting tens or hundreds a day, you need to be able to view them in groupings which are meaningful to your business and your support team. Otherwise, you risk becoming overwhelmed with a lot of tickets and unable to decide which ones require your attention. Just think if you never filed anything away in your life and you just put everything in one big pile. You\u2019d lose control of what was in it pretty quick.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this lesson, we\u2019re going to look at Zendesk <strong>Views<\/strong>. Views are customizable inboxesfor your support requests or tickets. To see your current views, click on the Views menu in the upper right of the menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p>Views organize your tickets into groupings which should help you stay on top of them. Perhaps you want to know which tickets need your attention; or to be reminded of tickets which haven\u2019t been addressed in a while; or see all the high priority tickets in your system. Views let you see your tickets in these and many more ways.<\/p>\r\n<p>While Zendesk provides you with some default views, it\u2019s important that you set up your own views which will help your support team focus on the tickets they need to address when they need to address them.<\/p>\r\n<p>We\u2019ll be changing one of Zendesk\u2019s default views to highlight which of our unsolved tickets are open (require our attention) and which are pending (waiting for more information from the customer). You\u2019ll recall from lesson one that <strong>Open<\/strong> and <strong>Pending<\/strong> are different ticket <strong>Statuses<\/strong>. This will help us focus in on which support issues we should be working on at the moment.<\/p>\r\n<p>We\u2019ll also deactivate some of the default views we aren\u2019t using at the moment.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"whats-open-whats-pending\">What\u2019s Open and What\u2019s Pending?<\/h2>\r\n<p>Before we actually change any of the views, let\u2019s check our main view -- My Unsolved Tickets. Click the <strong>View<\/strong> tab in the upper right of the top menu.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already, you should see a ticket in there from Kelly H. titled \u201cWelcome to Zendesk, You\u2019ve Got a Ticket!\u201d Kelly is a real-life Zendesk support agent. Click into the ticket and read what it says.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/demo-ticket-from-kelly.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"616\" height=\"337\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>She submitted this by sending an email to your default Zendesk support address (support@youraccount.zendesk.com). Because it will actually be helpful to what we are doing in this lesson, we are going to follow her directions: reply to the ticket and set it to pending.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recalling what we did in the first lesson:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Reply to Kelly as she suggests: How am I doing? <\/li>\r\n<li> Change the status to pending <\/li>\r\n<li> Update the ticket <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><em>TIP: If you want to check what happened when you hit submit, remember that you can always see the ticket log by clicking the All Events and Notifications link. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Now we are back in our view. Depending on how much testing you\u2019ve been doing on your own, you might only see the one pending ticket. Let\u2019s add another one for testing purposes -- since we are setting up our view to show us which tickets are pending and which are open, it would be better if we had an open ticket in there. It\u2019s a good practice to create test tickets as you work with your Zendesk. Every time you add something new or want to change something, you can use your test tickets to make sure it works as you expect. Better to test on yourself than on your customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>To create a new ticket click the <strong>New<\/strong> button in the top right of the menu bar. This brings you to a new ticket form.  While many tickets come in to your Zendesk via email, you might use the New Ticket button to create a ticket in response to a phone call, for example. The new ticket form looks like the tickets we\u2019ve been working with, except nothing has been filled in yet.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s say your boss has called you with an urgent request from a VIP customer. To keep track of that request, you create a new support ticket. Fill it out with the customer\u2019s information and the request.<\/p>\r\n<p>Because we have not communicated with this customer through Zendesk before, we need to add them to the system first. Click the <strong>add new user<\/strong> link under the <strong>Requester<\/strong> text field.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>NOTE: Zendesk requires an email for all customer tickets. This is why a customer account is automatically created when they email a question in; but why you need to add their email manually when filling out a new ticket. Put in the user\u2019s name and phone number if you have it.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/adding-a-new-user-from-within-a-ticket.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"413\" height=\"384\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Click create and then fill out the rest of the ticket with an urgent request. So even though you are the one filling out the ticket, you can ascribe it to the user. They will receive any further communication just like a normal ticket; and you will be able to reference this issue later when looking at their user account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Change the <strong>Type<\/strong> to Problem and the <strong>Priority<\/strong> to High. Your form should look something like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/creating-a-new-ticket-agent-view.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"611\" height=\"308\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Note that the customer data you just added is on display in the right column.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the submit button to create the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"list-vs-table-layout\">List vs. Table Layout<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now we have at least two tickets in our Unsolved Ticket view: the one from Kelly and the one we just created. They are currently displayed in <strong>List<\/strong> layout, which shows the subject of both tickets as well as the most recent comment. There is also a small label indicating whether the ticket is open -- and thus requires attention -- or whether it is pending -- meaning that you are waiting on further information.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/list-layout-views.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"617\" height=\"341\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>List layout is good for seeing the most recent activity on tickets, but we want to focus more on which of our unsolved tickets are pending and which are open. To do that, it is best to view the tickets in <strong>Table<\/strong> layout. It\u2019s best practice to create a list that separates all the tickets that currently require your attention from the tickets that don\u2019t. This will make your support agents and you much more focused and effective, especially if you are dealing with a large volume of tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p>To modify the layout, click the <strong>Table<\/strong> link in the upper right of the main column.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/table-layout-views.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"595\" height=\"212\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Nice! The Table View separates the tickets into two distinct areas, those that are open and those that are pending. So now when we look at our unsolved tickets, we can quickly see which ones require our attention.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note that by selecting Table view, we\u2019re not establishing a permanent change in how we view these tickets. Next time you go back to the Home Tab and then come back to view your tickets, they will be back in the List layout as it was when we started. So we\u2019ll edit our Unsolved Tickets view so that it always shows our tickets in table layout, and grouping our open and pending tickets.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"editing-a-view\">Editing a View<\/h3>\r\n<p>To change how a view looks (as well as which tickets it shows you), click the edit link in the top right bar (in the same place as the Table link you clicked earlier). Go to your <strong>Views &gt; My Unsolved Tickets<\/strong> if you aren\u2019t there already and click that green edit link.<\/p>\r\n<p>It looks similar to the <strong>Triggers<\/strong> screen we looked at in lesson one. Basically, the top section defines what kind of tickets you want to show up in the view (i.e. this could be tickets assigned to you, high priority tickets, tickets that haven\u2019t been responded to in over a month, etc.); while the bottom section sets how the page is organized.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/how-views-work.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"612\" height=\"592\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Under <strong>Formatting options<\/strong>, you\u2019ll see that you can switch the view from <strong>List<\/strong> to <strong>Table<\/strong>. Choose <strong>Table<\/strong>; this will make Table the default layout of your My Unsolved Tickets View.<\/p>\r\n<p>This opens up another set of options. While there are a lot of choices, it\u2019s basically a list of ticket data which you can select to include in this view. On the right are items of data you will see for each ticket; and on the left are all the other options you can include. To move items between lists, you just drag and drop the items you want.<\/p>\r\n<p>For right now, we just need some really basic data, most of which is already there. We want to see:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> who sent in the ticket - called the <strong>Requester<\/strong> in the table <\/li>\r\n<li> what the subject line is - called <strong>Subject<\/strong> <\/li>\r\n<li> when it came in - <strong>Request date<\/strong> <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>We don\u2019t really need score at this moment, so drag and drop it from the right column into the left. (Score shows you how important a ticket is in relationship to other tickets; helpful, but right now let\u2019s focus on the basics.) Leave everything else the same for now.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/moving-table-columns-editing-a-view.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"458\" height=\"201\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>So we now have the types of data we want to see about our tickets. What about grouping them by their status like we set out to do (open or pending)?<\/p>\r\n<p>You configure this in the <strong>Group By<\/strong> section underneath the columns. The drop down should be set to <strong>Status<\/strong> already, but if it\u2019s not, open up the drop-down and choose it. You\u2019ll see that there are many options for grouping your tickets in a particular view. This gives you a second level of organization within your views. For instance, you may want to see all your high priority tickets in one View, but then group them by which agent they are assigned to; or perhaps, what date they came in. In our case, we want to see which of our unsolved tickets are open and which are pending.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next section -- <strong>Order By<\/strong> -- reads <strong>Score<\/strong>. We removed score from our columns up above, so change that to Request Date. That will mean that within your groupings -- open or pending -- they will be in order of the date they came in, similar to how your email program works probably.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the update view. Now any time you look at your Unsolved Tickets, you\u2019ll see them in the table layout, grouped by their status.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/view-grouped-by-ticket-status.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"612\" height=\"218\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"removing-unused-views\">Removing Unused Views<\/h3>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s continue setting this up so your agents and you can better focus on what\u2019s important in your help desk right now. Even though you want to view your tickets into meaningful chunks or views (i.e. which tickets are open right now), you don\u2019t want more views than necessary. It\u2019s like going through the closet and saying: \u201cDo I really wear this?\u201d If not, get rid of it.<\/p>\r\n<p>To that end, we\u2019ll reduce the number of views you see when you click Views tab in the menu bar (see below).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/zendesk-default-views.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"271\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk\u2019s default views are based on customer service best practices. But when you\u2019re just starting out or if you don\u2019t have very many tickets, some of these default views may not be useful yet. We haven\u2019t gone over groups, for instance -- so let\u2019s disable some of these views.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can disable views in Zendesk without deleting them. This will allow you add them back to your list later when you feel they might be helpful. For now, let\u2019s disable <strong>New tickets in your groups<\/strong> and <strong>Unsolved tickets in your group<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click on the <strong>Manage<\/strong> tab in the top menu bar and choose <strong>Views<\/strong> from the sub menu. You\u2019ll see that it lists out the same views you see in the Views top menu drop-down. You also see that there are already some Inactive views. Roll your mouse over the <strong>New Tickets in your groups<\/strong> row. A menu reveals itself on the right with the option to <strong>deactivate<\/strong>. Click deactivate; the page reloads and now New Tickets in your groups is in the Inactive views. Do the same with Unsolved tickets in your groups.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/deactivating-views.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"617\" height=\"40\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Looking at our views is a little easier now (see below)<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/view-panel-after-deactivated-views.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"258\" height=\"257\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The remaining views in the list address scenarios we have seen and which are useful when you are just starting out with Zendesk:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> looking at all the unsolved tickets <\/li>\r\n<li> looking at tickets which have been recently updated or recently solved <\/li>\r\n<li> looking at all the tickets are pending (waiting on information from the customer) <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>There\u2019s one view which contains a piece of Zendesk we haven\u2019t addressed yet: unassigned tickets? All tickets in Zendesk must eventually be assigned to a support agent. Assignment means that the support agent will receive notifications when the ticket is updated; and it establishes a clear responsibility. As you are currently the only agent in your Zendesk, all tickets are automatically assigned to you.  We\u2019ll look further at Ticket Assignment in the next lesson when we begin adding additional agents to your Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h2>\r\n<p>In this lesson, we looked at how to organize the tickets we have in our help desk by using Zendesk Views. When you log into your Zendesk, you should open up your views and choose the one that best fits what you need to do at that moment -- typically, either dealing with unsolved tickets; or checking in with the backlog of tickets that are waiting on more customer information.<\/p>\r\n<p>We evaluated the difference between list format and table format, and chose table format for our main \u201cMy Unsolved Ticket\u201d view. This allowed us to easily distinguish between unsolved tickets that are open awaiting our action and which were pending on a customer response.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lastly, because we use views to help us focus on which support requests need our attention, we turned off certain default views that we don\u2019t need yet.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"extra-exercise\">Extra Exercise<\/h2>\r\n<p>Check your My Unsolved Tickets view and see whether Kelly H. has responded to her ticket. If she has, it should now be in the Open section of your view. This means she has replied. Because the ticket is now back in your court, Zendesk automatically moves it from pending to open. Review your ticket from Kelly H. and solve it. It\u2019s not good practice to leave tickets open longer than you have to.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Next Lesson: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041243-lesson-5-working-with-your-whole-team\">Working with your whole team \u2192<\/a><\/h4>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/19 09:31:29 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":20041188,"forum_id":20025588,"submitter_id":2851201,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":5,"is_locked":false,"hits":765,"created_at":"2011\/04\/19 17:00:01 -0700","title":"Lesson 5: Working with your whole team","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["agents","getting-started","people"],"body":"<p>In the previous lesson, we went over how to organize your support tickets into Views so your team and you can focus on which tickets matter most at that moment. In this lesson, we\u2019re going to start setting up your team. We will add an additional support agent to your help desk and show you how to organize your agents into groups.<\/p>\r\n<p>Working with others on a support team presents many challenges (as anyone who\u2019s tried to share one group email box will tell you). It can be difficult to know who has responded to what; or which issues should be handled by which person. The amount of time lost on trying to get your whole support team on the same page is a productivity killer.<\/p>\r\n<p>Also, if your team is more than a few people, you probably have agents who specialize in a particular aspect of your business. When issues related to that aspect come in, you need a way to get it to that person; and they need a way to manage their personal queue.<\/p>\r\n<p>To address these challenges, we\u2019re going to look at how to assign tickets to people on your support team. Each ticket within Zendesk is assigned to particular agent - adding a layer of accountability to your support work. We\u2019ll also see how you can use triggers to assign tickets to particular agents automatically based on the content of the ticket (i.e. all billing issues go to the agent who is the billing system expert). This will give us a chance to investigate the Zendesk web form, another way for your customers to get tickets into your Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>By the end of this lesson, you should be ready to start building up your team and assigning tickets to them; as well as creating the rules (or triggers) to automate how you assign tickets.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"the-three-types-of-users-in-zendesk\">The Three Types of Users in Zendesk<\/h2>\r\n<p>To add an additional agent to your team, go the <strong>People<\/strong> page under the <strong>Manage<\/strong> menu. Before we add a new agent, let\u2019s quickly look at the People page and the three different kinds of users in Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/manage-people.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"618\" height=\"445\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The above is a standard set of users for new trial users. The owner of the account is listed at the bottom (presumably you) - you can see the small owner label underneath their image. The owner is by default an admin of your Zendesk. You can create additional admins. The role of the admin is to manage how the help desk works and be in control of many of the global help desk settings.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you\u2019ve been following through the previous lessons you\u2019ll also see the two people from whom you received tickets -- the customer test account you created in Lesson 1 and Kelly H., the Zendesk employee whose ticket we discussed in Lesson 4.<\/p>\r\n<p>These two accounts are called <strong>end-user<\/strong> accounts; this is the type of user your customer will be. End-users can create tickets and contribute to your community forums, but they cannot do or see any of the behind the scenes management. Note that while you can create new end-user accounts manually, in most cases they are created automatically simply by the person sending in a ticket. An end-user does not have to sign up, in other words, to work with your help desk - they can just send in a ticket and Zendesk will remember them.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>ADVANCED TIP: you can change end-user access to your help desk -- for instance, require that new users create an account before they may submit a ticket -- in <strong>Settings &gt; End-Users<\/strong> tab.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Lastly, (thought not represented above) are your agents. Agents are those who answer tickets and moderate forums - they run your support day-to-day. (Note that admins can by default do all the things that agents can do.) Most support teams are made up of multiple people. Let\u2019s grow your team by adding our first additional support agent.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"adding-and-working-with-more-support-agents\">Adding and Working with More Support Agents<\/h2>\r\n<p>To add another agent, click <strong>Add user<\/strong> in the upper right of the main column. Fill out the form on the subsequent page, either with one of your colleague\u2019s information; or, if you are working alone, or just want to test Zendesk out further before bringing others in, you may use another of your email addresses to create a test agent account.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>TIP: When setting up Zendesk\u2019s we often advise that the owner create a test end-user and a test agent account. It helps greatly with set up as you can quickly test out how each type of user experiences the site. When doing so use names like Johnny End-User and Mary Agent, so you can quickly recognize them in your emails.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>To create the new agent:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Fill out name<\/li>\r\n<li>Fill out Email<\/li>\r\n<li>Optionally, upload a Photo<\/li>\r\n<li>Add a note in the note field that reads \u201cThis is &lt;your name&gt;\u2019s test agent account\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>You can leave Detailed Information, Twitter account, and Organization alone for now.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you get to roles, select <strong>Agent<\/strong> (<strong>End-user<\/strong> will be selected by default). A set of options opens up - these options allow you to finely control this particular person access and role within your help desk.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/changing-user-privileges.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"674\" height=\"373\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Because we are just getting started, it makes the most sense to bring on another agent with pretty broad access - someone who can help us get our Zendesk set up. We can always restrict it later. To do so, leave all the settings as is, except switch <strong>Can moderate topics in forums<\/strong> from No to Yes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the Create button and your new agent is created. Notice the Agent label below their image.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>ADVANCED TIP: Need to import a lot of users all at once? Zendesk also offers a few ways to bulk import your users. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.zendesk.com%2Fentries%2F14777&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-hwgbm159-SwcP-0avy450hlkkQ\">This support article<\/a> explains how.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/agent-label-on-user.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"437\" height=\"79\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The person you signed up will now receive a welcome email with a link that verifies their account and asks them to choose a password. If you are using one of your own email addresses to test this, go ahead and check your email and go through the verification process.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"creating-accountability-within-your-support-team\">Creating Accountability within Your Support Team by Assigning Tickets<\/h3>\r\n<p>One common problem in support teams with multiple people is establishing who is in charge of which support requests. If it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to answer a particular ticket, then it is effectively no one\u2019s responsibility. In Zendesk, each ticket must eventually have someone assigned to it (or, as we say it in Zendesk: have an <strong>assignee<\/strong>). In the previous lessons all tickets were by default assigned to you, since you were the only agent in the system.<\/p>\r\n<p>But now that you have another colleague working with you, the assignee must be set. Why does each ticket require an assignee? Because it clearly defines responsibility within your support workflow. Once a ticket is clearly assigned to a particular person, they are much more likely to address it, simply because no one else will. Assignment can always be passed off to another agent (if, for instance, another agent has a particular expertise that is better suited to the ticket), but at any given time it is clearly someone\u2019s.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s create a new ticket and assign it to the agent we just added to our help desk. Let\u2019s assume we just received a call from one of our customers who is experiencing a billing issue; and that our new agent is the billing expert in our organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>While on the phone with the customer, we open up a new ticket within Zendesk by clicking the New button in the upper right of the menu bar. They are a new customer and have not contacted our support before, so as in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041188-lesson-4-improving-your-views\">Lesson 4<\/a>, click the <strong>add a new user<\/strong>link under the <strong>Requester<\/strong> text box.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the Create button; this will bring you back to your ticket with the customer details filled in. Next, we\u2019ll fill out the ticket with the customer\u2019s issue - say, they were double-charged on their credit card. The subject can read, \u201cDouble-charge on credit card\u201d; in the description, you can make a note about what your call was about: \u201cI just got off the phone with this customer who is seeing a double-charge on their credit card.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, we want to assign it to the new agent we just added who is our support person in charge of billing issues. Notice that there is a new drop-down field on the ticket now: Assignee. Open it up and choose the new agent you just added. (You\u2019ll see that you are also an option in the drop-down as you are also an agent.) Leave the status of the ticket to New (until the new agent opens it, it is still a new issue); change the type to Incident; and make the priority High. It should look something like the screenshot below:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/the-assignee-ticket-field.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Click the Submit button. A new ticket is created. What happens now?<\/p>\r\n<p>First, Zendesk automatically notifies any agent who is assigned a ticket. It\u2019s fine to assign a ticket to someone, but it\u2019s no use if they don\u2019t know it was assigned to them. To confirm that they were notified, go back into the ticket by either clicking the link in the notification that tells you the ticket was created or by using the Recent Tickets menu in the top menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p>Scroll down the the <strong>Events<\/strong> section of the ticket and click the <strong>All events and notifications<\/strong> link on the right side. We\u2019ve looked at this in previous lessons - it logs every action taken on a ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/all-events-and-notifications-on-display.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"620\" height=\"319\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Here we see that the ticket was indeed assigned to our newly added agent; and that a notification was emailed to them (using a <strong>trigger<\/strong>).<\/p>\r\n<p>The email your agent receives looks like this (if you are using your own email to go through this lesson, you\u2019ll receive this email):<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/ticket-assignment-notification.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"553\" height=\"261\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The agent can then either follow the link or respond directly from email to work on this support request further.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you look at the Views menu in the upper right, you should now see a difference between My Unsolved Tickets and All Unsolved Tickets. My Unsolved Tickets collects all the unsolved tickets assigned to you; All Unsolved Tickets collects all the unsolved tickets period. Click into All Unsolved Tickets - if you remember the previous lesson, you\u2019ll see that this view groups the tickets by assignee (see below).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/view-grouped-by-assignee.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"610\" height=\"242\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"automatically-assigning-tickets-to-agents\">Automatically Assigning Tickets to Agents<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now that\u2019s we\u2019ve assigned a ticket to another agent (and gone over the reasons for why each support request should have an assignee), let\u2019s make the process more efficient by automating it. Remembering <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20040818-lesson-1-jumping-in-and-solving-your-first-ticket\">lesson 1<\/a>, we are going to be building a trigger that automatically assigns billing related tickets to our new support agent. While there will always be a need for you to manually assign tickets to other agents, it\u2019s a best practice to automate what you can within your help desk. This will reduce the amount of human error in your support -- forgetting to assign the ticket when you update it say -- and also allow your support to scale as more and more requests come in. It\u2019s one thing to read a couple billing related questions and assign them to our billing expert; it\u2019s another thing to do that with hundreds of tickets.<\/p>\r\n<p>The process we use here can be used to address most scenarios when you want to automate some piece of your support.<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>we\u2019ll define a task we do often <\/li>\r\n<li> we\u2019ll build a trigger (and any other component in Zendesk we need) to address that task <\/li>\r\n<li> we\u2019ll test what we\u2019ve built. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>We\u2019ve already defined what we want to automate: the process of assigning billing related support requests to our new agent (who is the billing expert on our team). Now let\u2019s look at the pieces we need to accomplish that.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"building-a-web-form\">Building a Web Form<\/h3>\r\n<p>First, we need to know which questions are billing questions or not. There are many ways to do this in Zendesk, but one of the most effective is to configure the support form on your Zendesk support site.<\/p>\r\n<p>To see the default support form, we need to put ourselves in our customers shoes. In Zendesk, you can assume the identity of any user of your support system. This means experiencing your help desk from their perspective. This can be helpful to guarantee that the system looks and behaves as you want it to for each person.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 1<\/h4>\r\n<p>Click on the <strong>Manage<\/strong> menu in the top navigation and choose <strong>People<\/strong>. Remember the distinction between end-user, admins and agents from earlier in the lesson. We want to assume the role of of an end-user. To do so click the <strong>assume<\/strong> link next to one of the end-user accounts (Kelly H., for instance; or any user without owner or agent underneath their image).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/assume-an-end-user.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"615\" height=\"636\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 2<\/h4>\r\n<p>This drops you back on to your homepage - it looks similar to the homepage we\u2019ve been looking at all along, but notice that the navigation bar is different. This is your Zendesk configured for someone who is looking for support. As such, an end-user can browse whatever knowledge base article or community forums you\u2019ve set up, or, as we want to do here, <strong>Submit a Request<\/strong>; you\u2019ll see a button labeled submit a request in the top menu bar. Click on that button.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/end-user-submits-a-request.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"615\" height=\"425\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This is the default support form - your customers can come to this page, fill out this form, and just like sending in an email, it will create a ticket for them in your Zendesk.  This ticket will look exactly the same for your agents and you.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ok, but how are we going to know which support requests that come in through this form are billing related? The answer is: in it\u2019s current form, it\u2019d be pretty tough. Luckily, Zendesk lets you edit and add things to this form. We are going to add a drop down field for our customers to fill out that asks them what type of question they are asking. With that information, we\u2019ll be able to accurately assign it to our support agent.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"adding-a-new-field-to-the-support-form\">Adding a New Field to the Support Form<\/h3>\r\n<p>To add a new field, we need to return to our admin status. To do so, click the <strong>Revert Identity<\/strong> link in the upper right of the page. Anytime you assume the identity of another user in your Zendesk, you need to click this link to get back your admin perspective. Doing so will drop you on the People page again.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now let\u2019s add that new field.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 1<\/h4>\r\n<p>Click the <strong>Manage<\/strong> menu and choose <strong>Ticket Fields<\/strong> from the options. This page lists all the various fields on your web form. You may notice that this list has many more fields than the one we were just looking at as an end-user. In fact, this lists all the fields we saw earlier in the lesson when we created a new ticket as an admin.  What\u2019s going on?<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk uses the same ticket form for both your agents and your end-users, it simply shows them different pieces of that form. The subject field, for instance (the first item on the list) is available to both agent and end-user - both types of users can enter in a subject for a ticket. The <strong>Status<\/strong> field, however, can only be seen and changed by an agent.<\/p>\r\n<p>Your support form is an important tool in capturing support requests because you can add many different types of information that a simple email simply cannot. While email is often very easy for customers and very important for the modern support team; the web form can really speed up and provide your support team with more information upfront.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 2<\/h4>\r\n<p>Click the <strong>Add custom field<\/strong>in the upper right of the main column. On the next page select drop down list.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 3<\/h4>\r\n<p>Here\u2019s where we configure our new field. Give the field a title (this is for internal use, so name it something you\u2019ll understand later like \u201cSupport Category\u201d) and then add a more descriptive question in the <strong>Field Title Displayed to End-users<\/strong>. This is what your customers will see when they access your web form, so it should be something like \u201cWhat are you writing us about?\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Leave <strong>Required for Agents<\/strong> unchecked, but definitely check Visible to end-users. This is what will put it on the customer support form. (Note that if you left that unchecked the field would still appear on your support form, but only for your agents.)<\/p>\r\n<p>This opens up a second set of options. Check <strong>Editable by end-users<\/strong> - this will make it so that they can actually open up and choose an option in the drop down (not actually edit its content). You would leave that box unchecked if you wanted to show them the current value of the field, but not let them change it, such as if you wanted to show them which agent was assigned to their ticket (which would be the assignee field, but you didn\u2019t want them to be able to change the assignee.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, add a short description which will help explain to users what you would like them to do in this instance, something like \u201cPlease specify what type of question or problem you're having.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Lastly, check the <strong>Required for end-users<\/strong> box. This makes our drop-down field required for end-users; they must fill it out before they are allowed to submit their request.<\/p>\r\n<p>Your drop down should currently look something like this.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/adding-a-text-field.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"623\" height=\"383\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 4<\/h4>\r\n<p>Now we will add the actual options we want our customers to choose from. In the section labeled <strong>Field Options<\/strong> add three or four options in the text field labeled <strong>Title<\/strong>. Make one of them \u201cBilling Issue\u201d. To add additional fields, click the green plus button to the right of the text fields.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/drop-down-fields-when-adding-a-ticket.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"604\" height=\"327\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Notice that each time you enter an option, a corresponding tag is created. Zendesk creates these automatically for you (though you can edit them if you wish). When a customer chooses one of these options, Zendesk will tag that particular ticket with the corresponding tag. We\u2019ll use these tags to create our trigger. That tag is how the trigger will now what kind of question it is, specifically if it\u2019s a billing question, and be able to assign it to our billing expert.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the Add Field button.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-trigger-to-automatically-assign-tickets\">Creating a Trigger to Automatically Assign Tickets<\/h3>\r\n<p>When you create the custom field, there is a notice at the top of the page that notifies us that we \u201cuse the field option tags to filter <a href=\"reports\">report<\/a>, <a href=\"rules?filter=views\">view<\/a>, <a href=\"rules?filter=triggers\">trigger<\/a> and <a href=\"rules?filter=automations\">automation<\/a> conditions and actions.\u201d We are going to create a trigger. Click that link.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Triggers<\/strong>, you\u2019ll remember, are business rules you define that run immediately after tickets are created or updated. For example, a trigger can be used to notify the customer when a ticket has been opened. Another can be created to then notify the customer when the ticket is solved. Zendesk starts you off with a number of triggers. For a description of those triggers, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011606-streamlining-workflow-with-ticket-updates-and-triggers\">Streamlining workflow with ticket updates and triggers<\/a> in the Zendesk support forums.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 1<\/h4>\r\n<p>We are adding a trigger to automatically assign billing related tickets to our new agent in charge of billing. Click<strong> add trigger<\/strong> in the upper right.<\/p>\r\n<p>Triggers contain conditions and actions. You combine these to create \u2018if\u2019 and \u2018then\u2019 statements (if the ticket contains a certain set of conditions then the actions make the desired updates to the ticket and optionally notify the requester or the support staff). You build condition and action statements using ticket properties, field operators, and the ticket property values.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 2<\/h4>\r\n<p>Filling out the form.<\/p>\r\n<p>Title the trigger \u201cAuto-assign to Billing\u201d. Open the dropdown under the <strong>Meet all of the following conditions<\/strong> header, and choose tags. This creates a second set of form fields. Leave the second dropdown as <strong>Contains at least one of the following<\/strong>. In the open text field write \u201cbilling_issue\u201d. Remember from the previous section that when a customer chooses \u201cBilling Issue\u201d on our ticket form it will tag their ticket with \u201cbilling_issue\u201d. We are leveraging that tag here in this trigger.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, click the green plus button to add another condition. Choose <strong>Ticket is...<\/strong>from the drop down. Open the resulting drop down and look at the options: <strong>Created<\/strong> and <strong>Updated<\/strong>. This is an important distinction. A ticket can only be created once, but it can be updated any number of times. In our case, we want this trigger to run when the ticket is created, so choose that in the drop down.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>HOW TRIGGERS WORK (sidebar): This is important because we only want the trigger to fire once. If we didn\u2019t specify a particular moment, then this trigger would fire every time a ticket tagged \u201cbilling_issue\u201d was updated. Every time you update a ticket (i.e. hit the submit button within the ticket as seen below), Zendesk runs through your triggers looking to see if that ticket fits any of the trigger conditions. We don\u2019t want the ticket to be assigned to our billing agent every time the ticket is updated; we just want it to be assigned once. So we choose created.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/create-ticket-button.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"322\" height=\"71\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>That covers the conditions. Next, open the drop down under the <strong>Perform these actions<\/strong>heading. What do we want to have happen? We want to assign the billing tickets; so choose <strong>Assignee<\/strong>, and then choose the agent you created earlier in the lesson. It should looks something like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/creating-a-trigger.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"616\" height=\"551\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Is there anything else we want to do? Well, we probably want to notify our new agent that a ticket has been assigned to them. We could click the green plus button and add another action. Let\u2019s see what that looks like.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click the green plus button. Choose <strong>Email user<\/strong> from the drop down. In the next drop down we want to choose our new agent. We could of course choose their name from the list, but a better technique is to pick <strong>(assignee)<\/strong>. Triggers can use placeholders like this -- send the email to the person assigned to this ticket. We just assigned the ticket to our new agent, so that applies in this case.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, before we create the default email to send to when a billing ticket comes in, we should come clean and say, we actually don\u2019t have to go through the trouble. It turns out that there is an easier and much more effective way to notify people when a ticket is assigned to them: fire another trigger that already notifies agents when a ticket is assigned to them.<\/p>\r\n<p>We saw before that emails are sent out when a ticket is assigned to an agent (see the image above). This was done by one of those default triggers Zendesk starts you off with. It\u2019s called <strong>Notify assignee of assignment<\/strong>. It turns out that one Zendesk trigger can trigger another; in our case, we have one trigger that assigns billing tickets to a particular agent, and we have another trigger that sends out emails to agents when a ticket is assigned to them. They can work together. To see how, we need to go back to our list of triggers. Let\u2019s save the trigger we\u2019re working on and check it out. Click the red minus button next to our <strong>Email User<\/strong>action and then click the <strong>Add Trigger<\/strong>button at the bottom.<\/p>\r\n<h4>STEP 3. Ordering Triggers<\/h4>\r\n<p>As we said, triggers can interact with one another, but they need to be in the correct order to do so. When a ticket is created or updated, Zendesk runs through all the triggers in order. This means that we want our <strong>Auto-assign trigger<\/strong> to be above the <strong>Notify assignee of assignment<\/strong> trigger. This will ensure that when a customer submits a billing issue ticket, it will first be assigned to our new agent; and then an email will be sent out to that agent. It doesn\u2019t work the other way around: you can\u2019t send an email out to the person assigned to the ticket before the ticket is assigned to anybody.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our new trigger is down at the bottom. To move it, click the <strong>Reorder<\/strong>button at the bottom of the list. Then drag the Auto-assign bar to the top.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/reordering-triggers.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"613\" height=\"428\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Now, we have all the pieces in place to automatically assign a ticket to someone. Let\u2019s test it out.<\/p>\r\n<h3 id=\"testing-our-trigger\">Testing Our Trigger<\/h3>\r\n<p>To test the trigger we are going to assume an end-user again. Following the steps from before, assume an end-user.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click <strong>Submit a Request<\/strong> in the top menu bar. Notice first that our new ticket field is there (sweet!). Fill out the ticket with a sample billing issue (you can copy what we have below); and make sure you choose \u201cBilling Issue\u201d from the Reason for Writing field.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/end-user-choosing-a-dropdown.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"615\" height=\"456\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Click submit and then revert identity (click the link in the upper right).<\/p>\r\n<p>To see the ticket that was just submitted, go to <strong>Views &gt; All Unsolved Tickets.<\/strong> The ticket you created should be in there. Click into it, and see that it is already assigned to our new agent. And, our new ticket field is also in there, already set to \u201cBilling Issue\u201d.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/trigger-automatically-assigned-evidence.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"619\" height=\"259\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Next, let\u2019s check further by clicking All Events and Notifications. Here we can see that not only our Auto-assign trigger worked; but also that one trigger fired the next:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/images\/documentation\/triggers-firing-other-triggers.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"435\" height=\"202\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>If you used one of your own email addresses for the second agent we added, you will get that notification in your inbox.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"unassigned-tickets\">Unassigned Tickets<\/h2>\r\n<p>One more small note to wrap up this lesson. Now that you\u2019ve got more than one agent, you\u2019ll notice that there is an <strong>Unassigned Tickets<\/strong>view in your View menu at the top. Unless you create an automatic assignment for all your incoming tickets, they will be unassigned by default. This view is a good place to check often - you want to make sure that unassigned tickets get assigned quickly.<\/p>\r\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\r\n<p>This was a pretty packed lesson. We went over the three different types of Zendesk users and added a second agent.<\/p>\r\n<p>We also introduced the concept of assigning tickets to your agents and went over two methods of assigning:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> manually changing the ticket fields <\/li>\r\n<li> automatically assigning using a trigger <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>In order to create the automatic assignment, we created a new ticket field for the Zendesk built-in support form.<\/p>\r\n<p>And we checked how this support form worked (and looked) by assuming an end-user.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now you are ready to add more people to your team as well as build up your support web form and your work flow!<\/p>\r\n<p>If you've gone through all the Getting Started Lessons, we have some suggestions about <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20052567-getting-started-where-to-go-next\">what to do and where to go next<\/a>...<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/19 09:34:03 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":20041243,"forum_id":20025588,"submitter_id":2851201,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":6,"is_locked":true,"hits":422,"created_at":"2011\/04\/25 10:31:11 -0700","title":"Getting started: where to go next","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<h2>Turning your Zendesk \u201con\u201d<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Email<\/h3>\r\n<p>It is easy to start using your Zendesk for real-life support.  If you have a support email address already in use, simply start forwarding all the incoming mail to your default Zendesk support email address.  Your default support address is support@youraccount.zendesk.com, where \"youraccount\" the site name you signed up for Zendesk with.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, for example, if you currently use support@mondocameras.com for email support, set up that email address to forward to support@mondocameras.zendesk.com.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more on using your own email address with Zendesk, refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041133-lesson-3-customizing-the-customer-experience\">Lesson 3: Customizing the customer experience<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the moment you start forwarding that mail, all your support communication will start flowing into Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you don\u2019t yet have a support email address you want to use, you can simply publicize your default Zendesk support email address.  Link to this address on your own website.  If at any time you want to start using a custom support email address, all you need to do is set up the forwarding as described above.  With that in place, the transition will be seamless.<\/p>\r\n<h3>On the web<\/h3>\r\n<p>You can also start offering web support through your Zendesk site by linking to your support web portal home page from your own website.  If you don\u2019t have one already, add a link to \u201cSupport\u201d or \u201cHelp\u201d and make that link go to your Zendesk web portal.<\/p>\r\n<p>Like your default support email address, your web portal is http:\/\/youraccount.zendesk.com<\/p>\r\n<p>For more on the web portal read the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20041133-lesson-3-customizing-the-customer-experience#3-customer-web-portal\">Configuring the Customer Web Portal Home Page<\/a> in Lesson 3.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about Zendesk<\/h2>\r\n<p>Zendesk has a number of resources to which you can turn when you need help or just want to learn more.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/categories\/12128-using-zendesk\">Using Zendesk forum<\/a> has definitive documentation on all the Zendesk features. <\/li>\r\n<li>Zendesk holds regular <a href=\"http:\/\/zendesk.com\/webinars\">webinars<\/a> -- live demonstrations and Q&amp;As about how to use Zendesk and many of its features.<\/li>\r\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/support.zendesk.com\">Zendesk Support Forums<\/a> are an active area of discussion about best practices and new features.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Below are some specific resources that might be of interest to you after this guide:<\/p>\r\n<h3>Streamlining your workflow<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/forums\/20004401-managing-the-help-desk-workflow\">Managing the Help Desk Workflow<\/a> (Using Zendesk)<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/zendesk-101\">Beginning Zendesk<\/a> (webinar)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Gaining business insight with support reporting &amp; analytics<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/gooddata-for-zendesk-twice-the-help-desk-data\">GoodData for Zendesk<\/a> (webinar)<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/webinar-creating-ticket-fields-tags-custom-reports-and-more\">Intermediate Zendesk<\/a> (webinar)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Building and extending your help desk<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/forums\/20004416-customizing-and-extending-your-help-desk\">Customizing and extending your help desk<\/a> (support forum)<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/integrations\">Zendesk Integrations Overview<\/a> <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Getting help<\/h2>\r\n<p>Of course, Zendesk support agents are on hand to answer questions and offer advice should you need it.

Let's take this scenario into account to explain this. I'm a small business, selling software as a service online. I have many integrations with companies much bigger than me, and often get tickets sent into me that should either be for my partner, or that I need help from a partner on.<\/p>\r\n<p>Traditionally, I'd have to tell the customer to redirect their question or resort to email to communicate with the partner. That's not good customer service, and things are bound to fall through the cracks.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, I set up an agreement in my Zendesk with my partner's Zendesk, which allows me to share my tickets with them. I've allowed my partner to make public comments, so they can speak directly to my customers when I ask them to.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, the process is not only seamless for the customer, who just wants their question answered, but me as the agent too - since I can keep that conversation in one place, one ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p>Still not getting it?

We've seen about a year's worth of independent operational issues compressed into the space of a week. I wanted to take the time to give a blow by blow summary of what has happened, what steps we have been taking and how we are moving forward from here.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here are the separate events that happened this week:<\/p>\r\n<h2>Core issues:<\/h2>\r\n<h3>MySQL bug:<\/h3>\r\n<p>We uncovered a bug that caused MySQL to crash. This was the primary cause of the issues we saw late last week (Thursday, Friday and Monday). We initially tried to upgrade to a more recent version of MySQL but discovered that not only did it not fix the bug but it also introduced a performance regression.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Steps we're taking:<\/h4>\r\n<p>We have a reproducible test case of this issue and both Percona and MySQL are working to find a fix. In the meanwhile we have put in a workaround to avoid the crash-prone behavior. We haven't seen a MySQL crash since we put in this workaround on Monday morning.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Network connectivity issues and related DNS issues:<\/h3>\r\n<p>We saw some issues with level 3's Chicago network on Wednesday evening. This resulted in some customers being unable to access Zendesk for a period of time on Wednesday evening. We also had issues with our DNS service on Thursday which resulted in email delays.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Steps we're taking:<\/h4>\r\n<p>We're working with our hosting provider to improve the level of communication around network outages and seeing if we can get additional notifications of external network maintenances in addition to the internal maintenances we already receive.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Hardware failure:<\/h3>\r\n<p>Early on Friday morning we suffered a hardware failure on our primary database; which required us to perform an additional failover.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Steps we're taking:<\/h4>\r\n<p>Hardware upgrades: These were already scheduled prior to the first occurrence of the MySQL bug. We have successfully added additional capacity to our web servers, databases and search servers. As as result we have improved overall system performance and decreased the peak load on our hardware. We're also increasing the size of our database clusters from 3 machines to 4 to give us additional headroom in situations where a machine has failed.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Operational issues:<\/h2>\r\n<p>We've also made our share of errors in the process of responding to the core issues some of which created additional problems.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Leaving backups enabled:<\/h3>\r\n<p>When we swapped database servers on Monday morning, we didn't swap backups so they continued to run on the live spare rather than the hot spare. This resulted in periods of sluggishness on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings from 10pm - 10:30pm Pacific (when our backups run).<\/p>\r\n<h4>Steps we're taking:<\/h4>\r\n<p>We're writing a more comprehensive database failover guide that includes steps to be taken after the swap has been completed in addition to the steps required for the swap itself.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Software bugs:<\/h3>\r\n<p>We uncovered a bug in search that caused us to green screen briefly during a hardware upgrade on Thursday morning. We also deployed bad code as part of a deploy intended to redistribute load between our servers which resulted in intermittent greenscreens on Thursday afternoon.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Steps we're taking:<\/h4>\r\n<p>We have good QA and deployment processes in place but this reminds us to always take our time and put changes through a thorough QA process even when we are under pressure to move quickly. We understand that mistakes are much more likely when we are tired and dealing with multiple issues simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Next steps:<\/h2>\r\n<p>We'll be watching our service closely over the next week and we've decided to <strong>schedule a maintenance<\/strong> for next <strong>Saturday (June 4th) between 10 and 11am Pacific<\/strong>. This will allow us to complete some of the upgrade work we had been planning and take additional steps to redistribute load and add redundancy.<\/p>\r\n<p>This has been a hard week for you and a hard week for us. We're really sorry and apologize for any interruption to your business. We value your patience and goodwill and look forward to putting these issues behind us.<\/p>\r\n<p>Please let us know if you have any questions and thanks again for bearing with us!<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk Operations<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/06\/01 13:09:13 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":13,"posts_count":3,"id":20158897,"forum_id":1,"submitter_id":11049728,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":true,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":230,"created_at":"2011\/05\/26 17:30:18 -0700","title":"Operations update","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["downtime","mysql","network","outage"],"body":"<p>Hi&nbsp;everyone,<\/p>\r\n<p>Four announcements today:<\/p>\r\n<p>Firstly, there was a network issue in Chicago on May 25th beginning at 9:05pm Pacific (04:05 UTC on May 26th) that impacted some of our customers' ability to reach Zendesk. Our hosting provider noticed the packet drop and acted to change routes and redirect packets around the failing network. Connectivity was completely restored in about 20 minutes (9:25pm Pacific - 04:25 UTC).<\/p>\r\n<p>We asked for an explanation and was told that this was a scheduled maintenance on the part of Level 3, a backbone network provider. Usually our hosting provider would route traffic away prior to such a maintenance, however they were not informed in advance it was occurring. They are following up with Level 3 to improve the communication channel.<\/p>\r\n<p>This issue was not related to the database issues we had earlier in the week; it is an unfortunate co-incidence that they happened so close together.<\/p>\r\n<p>Secondly, we had some DNS issues this afternoon between 3:40 and 4:05PM Pacific. We're still unsure of the root cause and are investigating.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thirdly, we have rolled out an upgrade that improves our capacity and are continuing to redistribute our load onto new hardware, a process that will continue over the next couple of weeks. This upgrade was planned well before we began having issues and we are hoping it will also improve database performance and increase stability.<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, our workaround for the MySQL bug appears to have been successful in avoiding additional crashes in production. We have also reproduced the problem in our test environment and are working with our support partner on a permanent fix.<\/p>\r\n<p>We're working hard to get service back to the level we've all become accustomed to over the past year; we'll post a further update tomorrow.<\/p>\r\n<p>Thanks for using Zendesk,<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk Operations<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/27 00:08:23 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":7,"posts_count":1,"id":20156492,"forum_id":1,"submitter_id":11049728,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":true,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":470,"created_at":"2011\/05\/23 17:11:25 -0700","title":"Outages over the past 5 days","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["downtime","mysql","outage"],"body":"<p><span style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; line-height: normal;\">I wanted to give everyone an update of the issues we've had over the&nbsp;past few days including early this AM (mid-morning in Europe).<br \/><br \/>As you might be aware from <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20135297-10-minute-database-maintenance-tonight-at-7pm-pdt\" title=\"our previous post\">our previous post<\/a>&nbsp;last week we uncovered a bug in MySQL.

We've since downgraded and put in an&nbsp;alternative fix to avoid the buggy behavior; as a result we have&nbsp;limited outbound emails to a maximum of 10,000 characters in length (this is the body size, headers are additional)<br \/><br \/>First off we want to apologize for these outages. We know that you&nbsp;expect a high level of performance and stability from Zendesk and we&nbsp;strive to exceed your expectations.<br \/><br \/>I also wanted to give a sense of the steps we are taking to resolve&nbsp;these issues:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>We have written a workaround so we avoid triggering the bug with&nbsp;our current email delivery system.<\/li>\r\n<li>We are tracking the bug (we believe it is MySQL bug 55284) and are&nbsp;working to get a version of MySQL containing a bug fix which is free of performance regressions.<\/li>\r\n<li>We are working on architecture changes to enable us to eliminate&nbsp;the use of MySQL in the email processing path. Thus we should no longer be vulnerable to this bug.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The first step is already complete and with hard work we hope to&nbsp;complete the next two steps during this week. Once we have completed&nbsp;the third step we will lift the 10K limitation on outbound email size.<br \/><br \/>We'll keep you updated with our progress.

In a nutshell, you turn the feature on and we send your customers a survey 24 hours after their ticket has been solved, simple as that.<\/p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">For your customers<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>We send an email 24 hours after a ticket has been solved, and asks the customer <strong>one<\/strong> simple question with <strong>two<\/strong> simple answers to choose from. It's really that simple for them.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/jriu8tvw5gsv4hk\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_11.23.51.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_11.23.51.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>When the customer makes their choice, they will be given the opportunity to give a comment. This lets you know, for example, the reason they rated a particular ticket as bad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a few more things to note about how customers can interact with Customer Satisfaction Ratings:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 17px;\">Customers don't have to rate from an email, they can also rate from the <strong>web interface<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 17px;\"><strong>Customers do not have to be logged in<\/strong> when clicking on the link from the email. This means if you run an email only helpdesk or simply don't want your customers having to register to your help desk, you can still use this feature.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 17px;\">You don't have you have an automation, you can customise the automation completely or turn it off. There is a <strong>placeholder<\/strong> available to you if you wish to put this in <strong>Triggers<\/strong> too:&nbsp;<\/span><strong>{{satisfaction.rating_section}}<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>We've designed this feature to be as easy as possible for customers to use. No complex thinking, no barriers to entry, just pure simplicity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">For your agents<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>Agents get to see all their customer satisfaction details too. From the <strong>Home page<\/strong> your agents will see a great deal of information about how they're affecting customer satisfaction:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/2t7kfddjjaq7aif\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_11.42.27.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_11.42.27.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Your agents can even click through and see the tickets rated as bad so they can immediately get the feedback they need and perhaps even turn the ticket around to be a good experience for the customer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As well as this, the <strong>top performers widget<\/strong> (an optional extra, which you can activate under Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Widgets &gt; Add Widget) has also seen a small update to allow agents to take their friendly competitive edge to a new level<\/p>\r\n<p>If you've never used the top&nbsp;performers&nbsp;widget before, we strongly recommend it! It really does encourage some healthy office competition.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">For admins<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>Admins on the Zendesk Plus+ plan will be able to see a <strong>new dashboard in the free <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/gooddata\" target=\"_blank\">GoodData integration<\/a><\/strong>. This will be able to display highly detailed information and trends about the customer satisfaction of agents as well as your overall account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>You'll even be able to see the top performers, the laggards and those customers who might need a bit of extra customer service! <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20058933-announcing-customer-satisfaction-ratings-in-gooddata-for-zendesk\">Check out more details on the new metrics for GoodData<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Views can also be created so you can see ratings as they're coming in. This also allows you or your agents to triage those customer's that aren't too happy with the customer service right now!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/dytsj8gwqaixcik\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_11.41.18.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 4px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_11.41.18.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>About Scores<\/h2>\r\n<p>Scores are not meant to be complex, but may need a little explanation to your agents. A score is calculated in the following simple way:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/788b5liqlvzpv4h\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-04-19_at_10.05.40.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-04-19_at_10.05.40.png\" align=\"center\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This means the score is an average of total positive ratings from the past 60 days. <strong>Agents<\/strong>, <strong>Groups<\/strong> &amp; <strong>Help desks<\/strong> all have scores.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>We wanted this score to be as simple to understand as possible in both meaning and calculation. You shouldn't have to work out what the magic formulae actually means.<\/p>\r\n<p>An agent with a score of 90% means that over the past 60 days, 90% of the ratings she has received were positive.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Getting started<\/h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ezguem5ypzzknxa\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_17.03.35.png\" style=\"width: 200px; margin-right: 8px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-04-20_at_17.03.35.png\" align=\"left\" \/><br \/>Turning Customer Satisfaction Ratings on is as easy as pressing one single button. All you need to do is go to Settings &gt; End-Users &gt; Satisfaction (Tab) &gt; Enable and then be sure to hit \"Save\". You're done!<br \/><br \/>When you enable this feature, an <strong>automation<\/strong> to control the sending of the email requesting a rating from customers will be activated, as well as a <strong>view<\/strong> to see all of your rated tickets. You may wish to customise these if you wish.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you turn this feature on, the automation only fires against tickets that <strong>are<\/strong> 24 hours after being solved at the point of the automation running. Therefore it will not actually fire against tickets that are 25, 26, 27, etc hours old. You do not need to worry that we'll suddenly send out thousands of emails from your account.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/25 15:55:56 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":16,"posts_count":165,"id":20052853,"forum_id":1,"submitter_id":4357391,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":true,"hits":228,"created_at":"2011\/04\/22 10:13:19 -0700","title":"GoodData for Zendesk and availability\/update issues","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p><strong>UPDATE 4\/24: &nbsp;All GoodData for Zendesk projects are now available and will accept new data refreshes as expected. &nbsp;Thanks for your patience.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>GoodData for Zendesk customers are currently experiencing inability to update their projects with new data from Zendesk. &nbsp;All customers should be able to access their projects but data will be only be current as of Wednesday, April 20 for many customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>When service is fully restored, customers will automatically see new data refresh in their GoodData projects according to their configured scheduled export. &nbsp;No data will be lost.<\/p>\r\n<p>GoodData expects that full service will be restored by tomorrow, Saturday, April 23. &nbsp;We will post updates here as availability is restored.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/04\/24 22:25:55 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":2,"posts_count":4,"id":20047953,"forum_id":1,"submitter_id":6343489,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":435,"created_at":"2011\/04\/11 13:39:01 -0700","title":"Announcing Beta Testing of Google Login for Zendesk","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["beta"],"body":"<p>We are excited to announce that Google Login for Zendesk will soon be available to customers for beta testing.

Now you can extend your central user management system to Zendesk using a secure, open standard that is quickly becoming the popular choice for federated identity. The ability to configure Zendesk to log in using SAML is available to all PLUS+ customers.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of using SAML for Zendesk include:<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">reduced cost of user administration by eliminating time spent creating and managing users in your help desk<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">simplified login experience for customers since they don't need to remember another username and password<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">How does SAML for Zendesk work?<\/h2>\r\n<p>When users visit your Zendesk help desk and click on login, they will be redirected to your SAML server for authentication. Your users' identities can either be stored on the SAML server, or can be validated by an identity directory such as Active Directory or LDAP. Once authenticated, users will be redirected to Zendesk with an active session.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/bypoi5apjik0w2c\/?name=SAML_Flow.png\" style=\"border: 0px initial initial;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SAML_Flow.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Return visitors will be automatically authenticated if their SAML assertions are cached.&nbsp;New users to your help desk will have a profile created automatically in Zendesk, but since they authenticated with SAML their profile will have no password. &nbsp;Of course, as an admin, you will be able to assign a separate password to their profile.<\/p>\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">How do admins enable SAML for Zendesk?<\/h2>\r\n<p>Before you begin configuring SAML for your Zendesk, you'll need the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>SAML server with provisioned users or connected to identity repository (Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)<\/li>\r\n<li>Remote Login URL for your SAML server (sometimes called SAML Single Sign-on URL)<\/li>\r\n<li>SHA1 fingerprint of the SAML certificate from your SAML server<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>Configuring your SAML server (OneLogin Example)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>You have several options when considering a SAML service, including building a SAML server in-house (e.g, OpenAM) or choosing a SAML service (e.g., OneLogin, PingIdentity, etc.). &nbsp;As an example, I'll walk you through how to configure OneLogin with Zendesk, but if you're using another type of SAML server, please scroll down for more instructions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you login to OneLogin, navigate to Security -&gt; SAML to find your SHA-1 fingerprint.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, click on \"Find Apps\" and search for \"Zendesk SAML\". Once selected, you can rename the app, specify that the authentication method is SAML, and specify the URL for your Zendesk (<em>accountname<\/em>.zendesk.com). Make sure your users have access to the app via the roles you've configured.<\/p>\r\n<p>After you click on Update, OneLogin will update the page with two URLs, one for SAML issuer and one for SAML Login URL. &nbsp;The latter is what you'll need to enter into the SAML configuration page within Zendesk as the Remote login URL. Below is an example of what you'll see after you update the app:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/vptt3aoxjtrdkaa\/?name=20110303-pg892np1g5rcmbapd141ia526e.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px initial initial;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"20110303-pg892np1g5rcmbapd141ia526e.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Other SAML servers may ask for the following information when configuring integration with Zendesk:<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Access Consumer Service (ACS) URL is&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/accountname.zendesk.com\/access\/saml\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/accountname.zendesk.com\/access\/saml<\/a>&nbsp;(case sensitive)<\/li>\r\n<li>Redirects to SAML Single Sign-on URL are HTTP POST<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Configuring SAML in Zendesk<\/h4>\r\n<p>Once you have this information, within your Zendesk, navigate to Account -&gt; Security and click on the Authentication tab.<\/p>\r\n<p>Click on the checkbox to Enable remote authentication and choose SAML from the Mode drop-down. &nbsp;In the Remote login URL text box, enter the SAML SSO URL of your SAML server. &nbsp;The Remote logout URL and IP ranges are both optional, but the Certificate Fingerprint is required for us to communicate with your SAML server. Below is an example SAML configuration:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/fwo4s3mk7jmzxcu\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-03-29_at_11.00.40_AM.png\" style=\"border: 0px initial initial;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-03-29_at_11.00.40_AM.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, please note that if your help desk has enabled Remote Authentication or SAML authentication, passwords will not expire since they are not stored in Zendesk. Additionally, if agents manually add a Zendesk password to their account, these passwords will not be expired.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Additional Information for Troubleshooting SAML Configuration<\/h4>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">To assist with troubleshooting, our SAML 2.0 metadata is:<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<pre><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?&gt;<br \/>&lt;EntityDescriptor entityID=\"<a href=\"http:\/\/zendesk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">zendesk.com<\/a>\" xmlns=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"&gt;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You now have the ability to increase the password security requirements for all the agents and users of your help desk. Some benefits of this feature include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Meet internal compliance and policy requirements<\/li>\r\n<li>Increase the security of your help desk<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Existing Customers<\/h4>\r\n<p>Current Zendesk customers don't have to do anything to retain their current security settings. Changing the security level is optional.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\"><strong>How does this feature work?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p>The password security functionality allows you to specify&nbsp;one&nbsp;global password security&nbsp;setting&nbsp;for all of your agents and end-users. You can choose any of these three options:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Low:<\/strong>&nbsp;password must be at least 5 characters <strong>(default for existing customers)<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Medium:<\/strong>&nbsp;password must be at least 6 characters and have alphanumeric complexity, with at least one non-alphanumeric character<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>High:<\/strong>&nbsp;password must be at least 6 characters and have alphanumeric complexity, with at least one non-alphanumeric character. Additionally, passwords will expire after 90 days and new passwords must be different from the previous 5 passwords.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\"><strong>User Experience<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p>When you increase the password security level,&nbsp;all&nbsp;passwords will be set to expire in 5 days since users must change their passwords to comply with the new security level. Users will immediately see an in-app notification to this regard.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: Verdana; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Admins and agents will also be notified three days before and then on the day that their password is set to expire. Users that fail to update their password within those five days will be prompted to do so the next time they log in to the help desk. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Please note that if your help desk has enabled Remote Authentication or SAML authentication, passwords will not expire since they are not stored in Zendesk. Additionally, if agents manually add a Zendesk password to their account, these passwords will not be expired.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>We've also added a global session timeout to Zendesk so that users who are inactive for two weeks will be logged out, which means there will be no impact to users who are actively using Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\"><strong>How Admins Can Change Password Security Level<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<p>Assuming that you're logged in as an account admin, navigate to Account -&gt; Security and then click on the Password Policy tab:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/rkdhcnnycuvowr5\/?name=Screen_shot_2011-03-30_at_3.02.45_PM.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen_shot_2011-03-30_at_3.02.45_PM.png\" \/><\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/04\/15 10:04:29 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":10,"id":510058,"forum_id":1,"submitter_id":22984495,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":548,"created_at":"2011\/03\/16 10:48:56 -0700","title":"Scheduled maintenance Saturday April 2nd","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["scheduled_maintenance","downtime","operations"],"body":"<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333; line-height: 1.4em; clear: left; font-size: 1em; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; line-height: 16px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Zendesk will have an hour long scheduled outage on Saturday April 2nd.

Here I'd like to focus on the first item we're currently working on, sharded database servers.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333; line-height: 1.4em; clear: left; font-size: 1em; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Zendesk has reached the stage where we are outgrowing a single database server. We long knew that this was inevitable given our growth and we've been planning for it for the last 6 months. What we are doing in this maintenance is changing our configuration and software to add a second primary database server.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333; line-height: 1.4em; clear: left; font-size: 1em; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is a relatively complex undertaking; as a multi-tenant application we have a large amount of middleware designed to segregate customers data, much of which assumed that this data all resided on a single server. This year, we began rolling out code changes to enable us to fetch data from multiple servers and combine it into a single front end.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333; line-height: 1.4em; clear: left; font-size: 1em; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most of these code changes are now in place and have been running smoothly for several months.&nbsp;However the change to add a second database needs to be co-ordinated across all our servers at once. Thus the need for the maintenance; it is a chance for us to bring the site down entirely, make configuration changes while the site has stopped; test the site is functioning correctly and then bring the site back up again.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333; line-height: 1.4em; clear: left; font-size: 1em; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">To use an imperfect analogy, we can redecorate the train and even repair the engine while it remains in motion, but in order to attach a second locomotive we need to bring it to a complete stop first. We'll have much of the engineering staff available during the maintenance to make sure that this is a smooth process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333; line-height: 1.4em; clear: left; font-size: 1em; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">We know that as our customers you have high expectations of the quality and reliability of Zendesk.

This happens in most cases, and does so when a valid email has been received.<\/li>\r\n<li>A bounce email gets sent back. This happens when &nbsp;a account has exceeded its limitations.<\/li>\r\n<li>A suspended ticket gets created. This happens when the email violates a processing rule (more on this below).<\/li>\r\n<li>A hard reject, email gets silently refused by Zendesk. This only happens in the single case where there's a 99.9% probability of the email being spam.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>The interesting part of the ticket processing engine, is item 3 in the above.

This will also happen to tickets that are sent from an address equal to your default reply-to address.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Unknown user tried to update existing ticket<\/strong> Someone tried to send an update to an existing ticket without having an account in Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>End user only allowed to update their own tickets<\/strong> An end user tried to update a ticket which was not submitted by himself. This typically happens when an end-user has multiple email addresses and replies to a notification from an address other than the one registered on the ticket either as assignee or cc.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Automated response mail, delivery failed<\/strong> If an email sent from your account got rejected somewhere in the email delivery mechanism.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Automated response mail, out of office<\/strong> An email sent from your account to an end user resulted in an \"out of office\" or \"vacation\" email, suspend this notice.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Detected email as being from a system user<\/strong> When the sender is another mail server (typically mail-daemon@something or postmaster@something) odds are that this mail was not intended to become a ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Permission denied for unknown email submitter<\/strong> Accounts that are configured to not accept email from anyone will get this cause of suspension when the sender does not exist in Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>User must sign up to submit email, user notified<\/strong> Accounts that are configured to accept email from anyone will get this cause of suspension.

It mostly depends on how qualified a ticket is - ie. if fields such as priority or assignee have been set. The more fields are set the lower the score is.<\/p>\r\n<p>We wanted to run a different method so that aspects like the age of the ticket and the importance of the customer are factored in. Unfortunately Zendesk provides no built-in way to do this but using the wonderful REST API it was quite straightorward to implement.<\/p>\r\n<p>First you will need to create an API endpoint which will perform the calculation of the score. I used the PHP Wrapper for the Zendesk API: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/zendesk-php-lib\/. Then setup a Zendesk Trigger to call the target when a Ticket is created or updated. Finally create a custom ticket field for numeric values to hold the ticket score and a view that orders tickets by custom score.<\/p>\r\n<p>The API endpoint in our case looks roughly like this:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; \/* how old a ticket may be before it is given the MAX_SCORE for the age component *\/<br \/>&nbsp; define('MAX_AGE', 14);<br \/>&nbsp; \/* the maximum score for each component (age, customer, priority etc.) *\/<br \/>&nbsp; define('MAX_SCORE', 10);<br \/>&nbsp; \/* ticket that can not be assigned to a customer receive a healthy default score so they don't<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp; * get lost *\/<br \/>&nbsp; define('DEFAULT_SCORE', 2 * MAX_SCORE);<br \/>&nbsp; \/* the maximum priority a ticket can have in Zendesk (4 = urgent) *\/<br \/>&nbsp; define('MAX_TICKET_PRIORITY', 4);<br \/>&nbsp; \/* how many tickets Zendesk returns per API call; this is hardcoded in Zendesk *\/<br \/>&nbsp; define('TICKETS_PER_PAGE', 15);<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; $zd = new Zendesk(...);<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; \/* get the ticket *\/<br \/>&nbsp; $ticket_id = $_GET['value'];<br \/>&nbsp; $ticket = simplexml_load_string($zd-&gt;get(ZENDESK_TICKETS, array('id' =&gt; $ticket_id)))<br \/>&nbsp; if ($zd-&gt;result['code'] != 200) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp; \/* handle error *\/<br \/> &nbsp; }<br \/> &nbsp; <br \/>&nbsp; \/* get some fields from the ticket *\/<br \/>&nbsp; $ticket_priority = $ticket-&gt;{'priority-id'};<br \/>&nbsp; $ticket_priority = (int) $ticket_priority;<br \/>&nbsp; $created_at = $ticket-&gt;{'created-at'};<br \/>&nbsp; $age = (int) ((time() - strtotime((String) $created_at[0])) \/ 60 \/ 60 \/ 24);<br \/><br \/>&nbsp; \/* get the importance of the customer from our internal customer database *\/<br \/>&nbsp; $customer_priority = ...<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; $score = $customer_priority + min($age, MAX_AGE) \/ MAX_AGE * MAX_SCORE + $ticket_priority \/ MAX_TICKET_PRIORITY * MAX_SCORE;<br \/>&nbsp; $zd-&gt;update(ZENDESK_TICKETS, array('id' =&gt; $ticket_id, 'details' =&gt; array(<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'ticket-field-entries' =&gt; array(<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; array('ticket-field-id' =&gt; 20037037, 'value' =&gt; $score),<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ),<br \/>&nbsp; )));<br \/>&nbsp; if ($zd-&gt;result['code'] != 200) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/* handle error *\/<br \/> &nbsp; }<br \/> <br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>As you can see the score is based on the weighted sum of the importance of the customer ($customer_priority), the age of the ticket and the priority.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to intialize the scores you can update all tickets:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; \/* Zendesk returns only 15 results per search result page so call this in a loop *\/&nbsp; <br \/>&nbsp; $page = 1;<br \/>&nbsp; do {<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $tickets = simplexml_load_string($zd-&gt;get(ZENDESK_SEARCH, array('query' =&gt; array('query' =&gt; 'status&lt;solved', 'page' =&gt; $page))));<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ($zd-&gt;result['code'] != 200) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; \/* handle error *\/<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; $num_tickets = $tickets['count'];<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; foreach ($tickets-&gt;record as $ticket) {<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ticket_id = $ticket-&gt;{'nice-id'};<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/* set the score using the code from above *\/<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set_score($ticket_id);<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br \/>&nbsp; } while ($page++ * TICKETS_PER_PAGE &lt; $num_tickets);<\/p>\r\n<p>This approach works like a charm and allows us to work on tickets from top to bottom. Urgent problems and important customers get a fast response time, and&nbsp; factoring in the ticket age also means that tickets will bubble to the top as they get older even if they are not that important.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/20 09:06:23 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":2,"posts_count":2,"id":20069716,"forum_id":3199,"submitter_id":16519992,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":5860,"created_at":"2009\/04\/08 10:26:35 -0700","title":"PHP API Library","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p>I've been working on a PHP class library that eases access to the ZenDesk API.&nbsp; It's available via Google Code at http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/zendesk-php-lib .&nbsp; Can use CURL with PHP 4 or 5 if it is available, otherwise it uses stream_context_create \/ file_get_contents and likely requires PHP 5.1.0.<\/p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><a name=\"Setup\"><span class=\"pln\">require_once <\/span><span class=\"str\">'Zendesk.php'<\/span><span class=\"pun\">;<\/span><span class=\"pln\"><br \/><br \/>$zd <\/span><span class=\"pun\">=<\/span><span class=\"pln\"> <\/span><span class=\"kwd\">new<\/span><span class=\"pln\"> <\/span><span class=\"typ\">Zendesk<\/span><span class=\"pun\">(<\/span><span class=\"pln\">ACCOUNT<\/span><span class=\"pun\">,<\/span><span class=\"pln\"> USERNAME<\/span><span class=\"pun\">,<\/span><span class=\"pln\"> PASSWORD<\/span><span class=\"pun\">);<\/span><\/a><span class=\"com\"><br \/><br \/>\/\/ returns users list in XML format (default)<\/span><a name=\"List\/Search\"><br \/><\/a><a name=\"List\/Search\"><span class=\"pln\">$result <\/span><span class=\"pun\">=<\/span><span class=\"pln\"> $zd<\/span><span class=\"pun\">-&gt;<\/span><span class=\"kwd\">get<\/span><span class=\"pun\">(<\/span><span class=\"pln\">ZENDESK_USERS<\/span><span class=\"pun\">);<\/span><\/a><a name=\"List\/Search\"><span class=\"pun\"><br \/><br \/>\/\/ swith to JSON<br \/>$zd-&gt;set_output(ZENDESK_OUTPUT_JSON);<\/span><\/a><a name=\"List\/Search\"><span class=\"pln\"><br \/>$result = $zd-&gt;get(ZENDESK_USERS);<br \/><\/span><\/a><\/pre>\r\n<p>More examples at http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/zendesk-php-lib\/wiki\/Examples .&nbsp; Hope someone finds it useful ;-)<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/18 18:16:31 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":4,"posts_count":53,"id":30891,"forum_id":3199,"submitter_id":36512,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":10307,"created_at":"2008\/10\/03 04:05:38 -0700","title":"CC'ing Recipients to Your Tickets (and Allowing Them to Butt In)","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: left; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333;\">Cc'ing&nbsp;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">is&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">disabled by default&nbsp;<span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">but can be enabled under SETTINGS \/ Tickets&nbsp;(\"<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong>Enable CCs on tickets<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"line-height: normal;\">\")<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: left; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 0px; color: #333333;\">When an end-user creates a ticket via email and Cc's other recipients in that email, the Cc recipients will receive email notifications on future updates to the ticket.

The score is an objective value for which tickets you need to address first. The higher the score the more urgent\/important the ticket is.  The score is a relative value. So even though you only have two working tickets in your help desk, and both of them are pretty tedious, they can still score 100.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<p>When calculating the score we consider a number of factors: How old is the ticket, how well has it been qualified and is somebody working on it. A ticket that hasn&#8217;t been qualified at all will typically score high, encouraging your agents to inspect and assign tickets as they come in. Ticket that has been lying around for a long time will score high, incidents will score higher than questions, and of course will urgent priority tickets score higher than lower priority tickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<p>An important consideration is that a ticket that has been lying around for a while unqualified easily can score higher than an urgent priority incident.

It. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Decided to walk around and find out what was up.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>User reaction can be summed up in three categories: (1) \"What help desk?\" (2) \"I hate it, I don't use it\" (3) \"Who are you again?\"<\/li>\r\n<li>Being a seasoned and highly trained I.T. professional and through hours of in-depth analysis and self-reflection I determined that people were not using my help desk because they hated it. (Yea, deep, I know.)<\/li>\r\n<li>Furthermore, my extensive experience told me to get a new help desk&nbsp;application. Yea, I'm that good. ;-)<\/li>\r\n<li>I started my search. I had two criteria - I would not host my next application, it would be simple, customizable and beautiful. Okay, that is more than two. Whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Looked at everything. Demoed a lot apps. There are a lot of really bad help desk applications out there. I will not call out my old application. You know who you are. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>It was painful.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Found Zendesk. Simple to use. Looks great. In the cloud. Nice.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Signed up. Customized it.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Beta tested it internally. Reaction was, \"That is cool!\"&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>\"You mean the help desk is...cool?\" I said. Yes, they did.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Launched it.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Threw a party.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Bribed users with food. Told them if they opened a ticket asking for food they could come and get some.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>An amazing thing happen. My coworkers did it...without help.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>And they ate my food. That part was not so amazing. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>I am now working on GoodData for Zendesk. Great reporting. In the cloud. Life is good.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Reaction is now. \"It's really easy to use\", \"We love it\", \"Service is so much better now.\" And EVERYBODY is using it.

This would be a winner for us if this could happen.<\/p>\r\n<p>thanks<\/p>\r\n<p>Brendon Winters<\/p>\r\n<\/p>","updated_at":"2009\/09\/24 11:03:14 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":3,"id":27819,"forum_id":38509,"submitter_id":40267,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":1443,"created_at":"2009\/09\/01 22:36:19 -0700","title":"Has save me 5 hours a week!!","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p>Hi guys, just a quick shout out!&nbsp; I always thought that we were so small of a company we could not afford big time customer service systems... now I can, and it is all thanks to you!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Highly recommend to anyone who gets emails about your products\/service<\/p>","updated_at":"2009\/09\/01 22:36:34 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":57075,"forum_id":38509,"submitter_id":3565835,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":1678,"created_at":"2009\/08\/20 13:58:08 -0700","title":"Zendesk Tags Schema","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p>I love the way Zendesk leverages tags.&nbsp; And I've been able to figure out that you use them throughout the application, as part of the architecture, rather than just associating human inserted labels that relate to a ticket.&nbsp; You've demonstrated a means to perform well, while growing more complex than the 'Toxi' and 'Scuttle' models.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Would you mind sharing your schema design for the tags, and how you use multi-tenant logic so that we only see our own tags?<\/p>","updated_at":"2009\/08\/20 13:58:08 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":54318,"forum_id":38509,"submitter_id":48533,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":1436,"created_at":"2009\/08\/13 21:52:59 -0700","title":"Windy Road Loves Zendesk","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p>Fast and simple and it works.&nbsp; The Integration and customisation features are awesome.

By understanding and making use of these statuses, you can stay on top of your support workload and bring any outstanding tickets to solved in an efficient manner.<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk Ticket Status can be manually set within each ticket via the Status Dropdown.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/zendesk.typepad.com\/.a\/6a00e0098d59f8883301310fccb854970c-pi\"><img class=\"asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e0098d59f8883301310fccb854970c image-full \" src=\"http:\/\/zendesk.typepad.com\/.a\/6a00e0098d59f8883301310fccb854970c-800wi\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Status1\" title=\"Status1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Within Zendesk, an <em>Open<\/em>&nbsp;ticket is defined as a ticket assigned to an agent. Open tickets are the heart of your support workload -- they indicate those issues that you're working on.&nbsp;Once a ticket's status has been changed from New, it can never be set back to New.<\/p>\r\n<p>Where this begins to be important is when you set up <strong>Views<\/strong>, <strong>Triggers<\/strong>, and <strong>Automations<\/strong> based on a ticket's status. &nbsp;It is probably useful, for instance, to see a grouping of all your Open tickets; all your tickets that need to be solved.<\/p>\r\n<p>But, of course, oftentimes to solve a ticket, you need to collect more information from the customer, e.g. you need the specific text of the error that they are seeing, or you need their account number, etc. &nbsp;So you write them back. &nbsp;In those cases, you want to be able to move the ticket off the list of things that need your attention but at the same time not forget about it. &nbsp;This is why the \"Pending\" status is so useful; it's like saying: \"This ticket is not yet solved but I'm waiting on something before I can work on it further.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>To see how this state might be useful, let's take a look at how you could set up a <strong>View<\/strong> that shows you all your unsolved tickets but groups them according to whether they are Open or Pending. &nbsp;(Views are collections of tickets that you can customize according to your support workflow.)<\/p>\r\n<p>To set up a new <strong>View<\/strong>, go to the <em>Views<\/em> section of the <em>Manage<\/em> tab. &nbsp;Click on \"Add View\" in the upper right.

We\u2019ve previously detailed all of the steps on email forwarding in our support forum, so please click <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/6974-forwarding-emails-from-microsoft-exchange-fastmail-or-gmail-to-zendesk\">here<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fruitbasket is currently using support@apples.com and support@oranges.com to receive requests from its customers.  To direct these requests to Zendesk, we forward the emails like this:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>support@apples.com to apples@fruitbasket.zendesk.com<\/li>\r\n<li>support@oranges.com to oranges@fruitbasket.zendesk.com<br \/><br \/><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>2. Creating custom views<\/h3>\r\n<p>With these email addresses in place, we can now create custom views.  Fruitbasket wants to create two unique views to better organize its incoming requests and to ensure that its support agents can quickly distinguish and work on the right product.  In other words, apples are receiving \u201capples\u201d support and oranges are receiving \u201coranges\u201d support.<\/p>\r\n<p>In general, \u201cViews\u201d are a great way to help you organize your incoming tickets into folders, while allowing you to know at any given time how many requests are open for a product.  In today\u2019s tip we will be setting up one view for apples and one view for oranges.<\/p>\r\n<p>To create a view, access the \u201cmanage\u201d tab &gt; \u201cviews\u201d in the the top menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/tow-fruit1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zendesk Views\" title=\"Zendesk Views\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>We will then select \u201cadd view\u201d from the upper right.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since Fruitbasket wants a view for all requests about apples, we will need to select \u201cTicket was received at\u201d from under \u201cMeet all of the following conditions\u201d and then enter \u201capples\u201d before \u201c@fruitbasket.zendesk.com,\u201d Fruitbasket will also need to create another view to filter all of its orange requests into one view.<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7617\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/tow-fruit2.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zendesk Triggers\" title=\"Zendesk Triggers\" width=\"440\" height=\"184\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>3. Communicating back to the customer<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now that Fruitbasket has requests being organized into two different views, it is time to start replying to its customers\u2019 questions and concerns.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since the company\u2019s customers will be sending requests to either support@apples.com or support@oranges.com, Fruitbasket would like its customers to receive all Zendesk tickets from the same email address where the request was originally sent.<\/p>\r\n<p>To do this, Fruitbasket will need to enable the \u201cpass through email addresses\u201d feature located under the Settings&gt; Channels&gt; Email.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/locojqffndlhlyh\/?name=Kelly_Hoffer_PhotoHelp____Kelly_Hoffer_PhotoHelp_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kelly_Hoffer_PhotoHelp____Kelly_Hoffer_PhotoHelp_.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This feature makes it so that all updates on emails get sent from the same email address that was used to receive the email (as long as the email address has been correctly forwarded to Zendesk per Step 1).  This means that Fruitbasket\u2019s customers will receive updates from either support@oranges.com or support@apples.com instead of a reply from support@fruitbasket.zendesk.com.<\/p>\r\n<p>With those three pieces in place, you should now be able to begin providing the customers of your various products with a separate  support experience.  To further extend this experience, you could leverage the <a href=\"http:\/\/zendesk.com\/api\">Zendesk API<\/a> for building custom support pages and forums.  For that we encourage you to check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/266176-the-zendesk-api\">API video tutorial<\/a>.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/20 16:35:17 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":4,"posts_count":3,"id":301270,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":16002092,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":658,"created_at":"2010\/10\/21 16:45:00 -0700","title":"Make All Ticket Comments Private By Default","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p class=\"lead\"><span class=\"zc-posting-info\">By <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/author\/matthew\/\" title=\"Posts by Matthew Latkiewicz\">Matthew Latkiewicz<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"lead\">Your agents reply to customer tickets by adding comments to them.

In this tip, we\u2019ll show you how to add a similar header to the emails you send out through your Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>As you know, your Zendesk comes ready with email integration.  Using Triggers, your Zendesk can send out email updates for pretty much anything that happens within your support tickets and support workflow.  Including some even minimal branding on that communication helps establish the legitimacy of your support communication, as well as adds a bit of polish.<\/p>\r\n<p>As with the previous tip, it helps to understand some basic HTML and CSS before tackling these tasks.<br \/><\/p>\r\n<h2>The Default Email Template<\/h2>\r\n<p>When you sign up for a Zendesk account, you start with the default email template.  Zendesk sends out HTML emails.  You can see and change the HTML for this template by going to <strong>Settings&gt; Channels&gt; Email<\/strong>&nbsp;in the top navbar.  It is, appropriately enough, labeled \u201cHTML email template\u201d.<\/p>\r\n<p>So we know what we are working with, it is helpful to submit a test ticket to your Zendesk.  If you are working with the default triggers (listed under <strong>Manage<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Trigger and mail notifications<\/strong>), submitting a test ticket will generate an email back to you.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>NOTE: Make sure you use an email address different than the one you use to access your Zendesk account when testing this stuff.  In a lot of cases, the default triggers will not generate emails if you submitted the ticket using your Zendesk account email \u2013 the idea being that you sent in the email, so you probably don\u2019t need to be notified that you sent it.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>For our tip, we want to add our company logo to the default email that is sent out, as well as change the colors to match our brand.<br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-email-before.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"276\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Making the Changes<\/h2>\r\n<p>Back on the&nbsp;<strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Settings&gt; Channels&gt; Email&nbsp;<\/strong>page, we can start changing the HTML.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Adding the Logo<\/h3>\r\n<p>First, you\u2019ll need to generate an appropriately sized image for your logo.  Because a lot of email programs have variable width, it\u2019s safe to stick to something under 600px or even smaller if you can.  Here is ours:<br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-email-header-export.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" width=\"532\" height=\"73\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>We will upload to our server, or somewhere we can access it using a public URL.  Once it\u2019s uploaded, take the public URL and insert it on it\u2019s own row in the header table.  So if the original code looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n&lt;table width=\"100%\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;td style=\"font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: #fff; \r\n    \t\tline-height: 1.5em;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\r\n    \t\twidth: 100%;text-align: center;background: #98c332; padding:8px; margin:4px\"&gt;\r\n    \t\r\n          {{header}}\r\n        &lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;\/table&gt;\r\n<\/code>\r\n<\/pre>\r\n<p><br \/>We will add our new row right underneath the opening \u201ctable\u201d tag.<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n&lt;table width=\"100%\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;tr&gt;&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/mattlatmatt.com\/shared\/totw-email-header-export.png\" \/&gt;&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;td style=\"font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: #fff; \r\n    \t\tline-height: 1.5em;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; \r\n    \t\twidth: 100%;text-align: center;background: #98c332; padding:8px; margin:4px\"&gt;\r\n          {{header}}\r\n        &lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;\/table&gt;\r\n<\/code>\r\n<\/pre>\r\n<p><br \/>Hit <em>Save<\/em> at the bottom of the page to save your changes.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To check the change, go back to your test ticket and add an update.  Again, using the default triggers, this will send out an email notification back to you.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-email-header-step21.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"210\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So our logo looks good, but the green color doesn\u2019t fit with our brand.  Let\u2019s change that.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Changing Email Colors<\/h3>\r\n<p>Back to our Zendesk account&nbsp;<strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Settings&gt; Channels&gt; Email<\/strong>&nbsp;page.  The color is controlled within the background attribute of the \u201ctd\u201d tag:<br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-email-header-step3.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"175\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The number \u201c#98c332\u2033 is called a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_colors#Converting_RGB_to_hexadecimal\">hex color<\/a>.  We need to change what\u2019s there \u2014 which makes it green \u2014 to \u201c#CC9933\u2033, a color from our branding.  There is one section in the template which controls the top color and one that controls the bottom.  We\u2019ll make sure and change them both.  So now the code looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\n&lt;td style=\"font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: #fff; \r\n\t\tline-height: 1.5em;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; \r\n\t\twidth: 100%;text-align: center;background: #CC9933; padding:8px; margin:4px\"&gt;\r\n&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n<\/code>\r\n<\/pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>We will save our settings again, and then update our test ticket to send out another email update.<br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-email-header-step4.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Add a Custom Header to Your Support Emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"258\" \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Looks good.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>You can take those principals now and take it even further if you like.  Just make sure you read the explanation of some of the Zendesk tags in there like {{header}} and {{content}} as they affect what is actually sent out in your emails.<\/p>\r\n<!-- .entry-content -->","updated_at":"2011\/05\/20 16:21:10 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":2,"posts_count":6,"id":296311,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":16002092,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":2051,"created_at":"2010\/10\/08 15:08:04 -0700","title":"Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<p class=\"lead\"><span class=\"zc-posting-info\">By <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/author\/matthew\/\" title=\"Posts by Matthew Latkiewicz\">Matthew Latkiewicz<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"lead\">A while back, our CEO Mikkel Svane called out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/user-interface-customization-with-the-css-widget\" target=\"_blank\">some impressive Zendesk design implementations<\/a>.  Zendesk allows the web developers among you, to leverage both custom CSS and Javascript in order to do some extensive customization of a Zendesk Help Desk.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this Zendesk Tip of the Week, I wanted to show you how to customize your entire header and page background. It will be all CSS \u2013 and while some basic CSS knowledge will help you understand what\u2019s going on, hopefully this can inspire anybody personalize their Zendesk. You\u2019ll be well on your way to achieving what our friends at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carbonguerrilla.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Guerilla<\/a> have done with their Zendesk (see the image above).<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Before and After<\/h2>\r\n<p>For our example, we are going to be taking a default Zendesk implementation:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-before.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>and turning it into this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-final1.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Setting up the CSS<\/h2>\r\n<p>First thing we need to do is set up a Global CSS Widget on our Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-global-css-widget-2.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px; margin-right: 15px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"totw global css widget-2.png\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>To do so, go to the <strong>Widgets<\/strong> page under the&nbsp;<strong>Settings&gt; Extensions<\/strong>&nbsp;tab in the top navbar.  Click <em>Add Widget<\/em> in the upper right.  On the next page, scroll down and choose <em>Global CSS Widget<\/em> (see sidebar).<\/p>\r\n<p>This will drop us into the widget itself.  You can name it whatever you want \u2014 the name is for admin use only \u2014 but we suggest making it descriptive.  Leave the availability as is.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the text box is where we will add the CSS necessary to customize our header and site background.  However, before we do that, we need to figure out exactly what HTML elements we are doing the styling on.  Again, it helps if you know a bit about CSS here, but basically, in order to change the elements of the header that are green or which display the Zendesk logo, we need to know what those elements are.<\/p>\r\n<p>The best way to figure out to which elements we want to apply our CSS rules, is to use a browser tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/getfirebug.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firebug<\/a> for Firefox, or the built-in <a href=\"http:\/\/\" target=\"_blank\">developer tools<\/a> for webkit-based browsers such as Safari and Chrome.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using one of these types of tools, you can right-click on any part of your help desk header and figure out exactly what the HTML element is.  For instance, here I\u2019ve figured out that the green band in the header is set (appropriately enough) by a div called \u201cheader.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-inspect-element.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" width=\"620\" height=\"414\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>If you\u2019ve used the browser developer tools or Firebug before, you\u2019ll know that you can then modify and change the current CSS rules to get a better sense of which HTML elements control which styles.  By going through this process, I have found out that I need to write rules for the following HTML elements (in CSS, elements with a particular ID are prefaced with a hash tag, while the actual tags are written without prefix):<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>body \u2013 <em>controls the background color of the page<\/em><\/li>\r\n<li>#header \u2013 <em>controls what goes across the top of the page above the top navbar<\/em><\/li>\r\n<li>#page \u2013 <em>controls the white margin you get on a default Zendesk implementation<\/em><\/li>\r\n<li>#table_header \u2013 <em>controls the space in the header containing the Zendesk logo and help desk name<\/em><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Making Our Changes<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Step 1 \u2013 Page Background Color<\/h3>\r\n<p>First thing, I want to change the page color to a cool orange color, to reflect my (in this case fictional) company site.  To do so, I go to the CSS Global Widget I created earlier and put in this rule:<\/p>\r\n<pre><code>\r\nbody {\r\n\tbackground-color:#CC9933;\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n<p>Hit update and it makes a small change.  This will be more important later when we connect up our header.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/totw-step1.png\" style=\"position: relative; left: 20px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Customize Your Help Desk Header Using CSS\" width=\"619\" height=\"189\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3><br \/>Step 2 \u2013 Swapping out the Header<\/h3>\r\n<p>Next we want to add the header that looks similar to the rest of our company site.  For that you need to create an image based on your company\u2019s site header.  Because Zendesk has a fluid layout by default (its dimensions change based on the size of the browser) you\u2019ll want to make sure that your header won\u2019t look silly as the page resizes.<\/p>\r\n<p>I create a header image and uploaded to my server so that I can access the URL using the CSS \u201cbackground-image\u201d property (see below).

Here at Zendesk, we have turned many a ticket into macros (over 100 at last count).  With all these macros now in place, we\u2019ve realized that keeping that knowledge up to date has become \u2026 well\u2026 just as important as creating new macros.  This week\u2019s tip will discuss how tags (and if you are a Zendesk Plus+ customer, how leveraging the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/get-advanced-analytics-with-gooddata-for-zendesk\">Zendesk GoodData integration<\/a>) can help you manage your own Zendesk macros.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Tagging Your Macros<\/h2>\r\n<p>The first step is to create a unique tag for every macro.  To access your macros go to <em>manage &gt; macros<\/em> in your top menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p>Select \u201c<em>edit<\/em>\u201d for the macro in question and from within the \u201c<em>Perform these actions<\/em>\u201d section, you will select \u201c<em>Append tags<\/em>\u201d and add the tag of your choice in the text box to the right.<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5484\" src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-shot-2010-07-29-at-12.00.48-PM.png\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Append Tag to Macros\" title=\"Append Tag to Macros\" width=\"620\" height=\"173\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>With this in place, a tag will automatically be appended to every ticket when we use the macro to answer an end user\u2019s inquiry.  (Please note that if you select \u201cSet tags\u201d instead of \u201cAppend tags\u201d, the \u201cset tag\u201d action will entirely replace any other tags on the ticket.)<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5488\" src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-shot-2010-07-29-at-12.04.02-PM1.png\" border=\"1\" alt=\"append tag to macros\" title=\"append tag to macros\" width=\"620\" height=\"336\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2><br \/>Analyze Your Macros<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now that we are tracking our macro use with tags, we want to be able to analyze how much each of our macros are being used.   To do so, we can create a macro report using Zendesk\u2019s integration with GoodData.  <a href=\"http:\/\/gooddata.com\">GoodData<\/a> is a business intelligence software platform-as-a-service (BI PaaS) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/my-dear-aunt-sally-taught-me-how-to-analyze-my-business\">recently made available<\/a> at no cost to Zendesk Plus+ customers.  (Note that Regular and Starter customers can also leverage Zendesk\u2019s built-in reports, which were described in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/tip-of-the-week-review-ticket-resolution-times-with-reports\">a previous Tip of the Week<\/a>.)<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5489\" src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/GoodData-report.png\" border=\"1\" alt=\"GoodData report\" title=\"GoodData report\" width=\"291\" height=\"469\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>To analyze the frequency in which macros are used, simply create a tag report for the desired time range within your GoodData account. All you will need to do is select the tags associated with your macros and run the report. A list of your macro tags and the number of times each tag has been used will be generated.<\/p>\r\n<p>Using your GoodData report, you can analyze which macros are used time and time again and\/or which are maybe not used that much.  From there you can make some informed business decisions \u2014 i.e. would a simple change in your user interface or website allow us to reduce the number of times you receive this frequently asked question?  Or could your macro response be added to your FAQ\u2019s forum?  Or maybe you will observe that some macros are now longer as effective and can be retired from your list of responses.<\/p>\r\n<p>However you analyze the data, tags are a great (and often under-utilized) way to monitor, review, and analyze many aspects of your Zendesk use.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/04\/07 08:39:16 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":2,"id":276288,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":16002092,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":1652,"created_at":"2010\/06\/28 11:50:06 -0700","title":"Use Problem and Incidents to Organize and Speed Up Your Support","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["incident","problem_incident"],"body":"<p>Not all support tickets are the same - your customers have different reasons for getting in touch with you.  As such, not all Zendesk tickets work the same way.  A Zendesk ticket can be one of four types: a <em>Question<\/em>, a <em>Problem<\/em>, an <em>Incident<\/em>, and a <em>Task<\/em>.  Each of these types allows you as the support person to do different things with the ticket based on the issue at hand.  A <em>Question<\/em> is the most straightforward - a customer has a question and you try and resolve it.  But what about if one of your customers writes in about a problem they are having with your service?  Like, for instance, you run an online store and the billing part is not working.  In this case you'll want to take advantage of Zendesk <em>Problem<\/em> and <em>Incident<\/em> tickets.  The benefit of this goes beyond the naming.  In Zendesk Problems and Incidents are related; specifically a Problem can have many Incidents attached to it.  Let me show you how it works.  First a ticket comes in alerting me that one customer is having trouble checking out of my store.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/example1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Problem Ticket\" width=\"620\" height=\"187\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I verify that indeed, the credit card authorization is not working.  This is not a question about the billing - something is indeed broken.  I classify the ticket as a problem by changing it's type and let the customer know we are working on it.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/classify-problem-ticket.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"classify-problem-ticket\" width=\"620\" height=\"377\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Up to now it's worked like a standard question ticket.  It's when I get another ticket mentioning the same problem that the Problem\/Incident relationship becomes more important.  A second customer writes in about not being able to check-out of my store.  In this case, I classify the ticket as an <em>incident<\/em>.  This ticket is an incident of a problem I already know about.  When I do that, a second drop down opens up asking me to \"Link incident to problem\".  I link it to the previous ticket that came in.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/classifying-incident.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"classifying-incident\" width=\"620\" height=\"242\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I can keep doing this as more related incidents come in.  This way, I'm keeping all the tickets related to my billing issue linked together.  When I go back to the original problem ticket, I see all its associated incidents.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/associated-incidents.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"associated-incidents\" width=\"620\" height=\"135\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>And there is a link back to the original problem ticket within each incident.  When I figure out and fix the issue with my billing, I can mark the problem ticket as solved.  But it's not just the problem that gets solved - it's also all the incidents.  Solving a problem ticket will also automatically solve and add any comment you included while solving to all the related incidents.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/solving-problems.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"solving-problems\" width=\"620\" height=\"62\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Leveraging Problems and Incidents can help you organize and streamline your support process when problems arise.

Because they can be used in many different contexts, they are often your best bet when trying to set up custom workflows.  We <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/tip-of-the-week-analyzing-macro-use-with-tags\">discussed previously<\/a> how you can use tags to analyze your macro use.  In this tip of the week, we\u2019re going to see how tags can be used to build automated workflows when using custom fields.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"lead\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Adding Custom Fields<\/h2>\r\n<p>Adding custom fields to your Zendesk web form allows the form to fit your specific business\u2019 needs. For instance, let\u2019s say you run a screen-printing business, and you direct customers to your Zendesk web form to field questions about your various products.  In order to make the form more relevant to your business, you\u2019ll want to add a custom field called \u201cproducts.\u201d This way, your customers can indicate which products they are writing about.<\/p>\r\n<p>To do so, go to the Manage tab in the top navbar and click Ticket Fields.  Next choose \u201cadd custom field\u201d in the upper right.  You can add a number of different kinds of fields to your customer request web form, but for now, let\u2019s go with a drop-down list.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the next page, you\u2019ll fill out the options for your new ticket field.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/custom-fields-zendesk.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" width=\"620\" height=\"598\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Custom fields can be for agents only, or you can make them visible to end-users.  In this example, let\u2019s make the fields visible and also editable \u2014 meaning your customers can choose a product and change the value of this field.  You can also enter the options you want to include in the dropdown.<\/p>\r\n<p>Note that each custom field automatically gets an associated tag. You\u2019ll see why in just a second.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>When you save your custom field, visitors to your Zendesk web portal can now see it.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/custom-field-zendesk-end-user.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" width=\"620\" height=\"170\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Anytime a customer fills out a web form and chooses one of the products, the corresponding tag will be automatically added to that ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/tag-in-a-ticket.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" width=\"620\" height=\"268\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Acting on Our Custom Fields<\/h2>\r\n<p>One of the most powerful features of Zendesk are the triggers.  We\u2019ve discussed triggers before in this series, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/setup-auto-responses-to-common-questions-with-triggers\" target=\"_blank\">setting up auto-responses to common questions<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/tip-of-the-week-organize-incoming-support-requests-with-multiple-email-addresses\" target=\"_blank\">organizing tickets with multiple email addresses<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/tip-of-the-week-automations-vs-triggers-when-to-use-what\" target=\"_blank\">when it\u2019s best to use automation or triggers<\/a>.  Triggers are the automatic actions taken when certain conditions are met within your Zendesk. With triggers, you can, among other things, send out an email to your agents when a new ticket comes in and automatically change the priority of a ticket based on what the subject line says.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s say you want to automatically assign the tickets that come in based on the custom field you <em>just<\/em> created.  When a customer chooses t-shirt, for example, you want that ticket to go to your guy in charge of t-shirts.  You can accomplish this with a trigger.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>To add a new trigger, again go to the Manage tab.  This time choose Triggers &amp; Mail Notifications and click \u201cadd trigger\u201d in the upper right.<\/p>\r\n<p>You want the condition that fires this trigger to be when a customer chooses \u201ct-shirt\u201d in your newly created Products ticket field.  When you look at the options, you can see all of the built in fields, such as Status, Type, and Priority, but you won\u2019t see your custom field.  How can you build a trigger that fires off your custom field then? Turn to tags.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/trigger-conditions-zendesk-2.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"trigger-conditions-zendesk 2.png\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" width=\"620\" height=\"406\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now you can build your trigger based on the tag \u201ct-shirts,\u201d which as seen above, is automatically added to the ticket when a customer chooses that option on the request web form.<\/p>\r\n<p>A simple version of the trigger looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/trigger-creation-zendesk.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Build Custom Workflows With Tags\" width=\"620\" height=\"564\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, anytime a customer chooses \u201ct-shirts\u201d on the web form, their ticket will be automatically assigned to your guy in charge of t-shirts.<\/p>\r\n<p>We know that everybody\u2019s support needs and workflow will differ. In order to sculpt Zendesk to better fit your needs, you\u2019ll want to check out custom fields and tags.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/03\/24 09:11:07 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":3,"posts_count":5,"id":276290,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":16002092,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":1101,"created_at":"2010\/04\/22 09:27:07 -0700","title":"Setup Auto-Responses to Common Questions with Triggers","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["auto-response","trigger"],"body":"<p>One of the keys to streamlining your customer support is responding appropriately to tickets as they come in and as they go through your support process. Obviously you want to respond as quickly as you can to your customers; and you want to respond with helpful answers. Those are some of the human responses that your support needs. But you also want to maximize your support resources. You don't want to tie up your support agents with the same question over and over -- if you can help it. These are the types of responses that make more sense for your software to handle.<\/p>\r\n<p>We've mentioned before how you can create canned responses in Zendesk with Macros. Macros still require some manual intervention however. For those questions you see time and time again, you might be able to create an auto-response through the use of Triggers. Triggers are automatic actions taken when certain conditions are met. They are a very powerful tool within Zendesk and can make sure that you are responding to your tickets in the most efficient way possible. Crystal Taylor, the head of support at Twitter said it best: \"My favorite [Zendesk] feature is the Trigger feature because they're basically like rules on crack.\" She goes on to explain that \"not only can triggers help to filter, categorize, and tag specific ticket requests but they can also fire off specific actions that previously would have required a human or some kind of manual intervention to do.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>So, for instance, let's say you receive multiple tickets from customers about forgetting their password for your service. Rather than answering each of those manually, you could create a trigger that sends an auto-response explaining the password changing process when a new ticket includes the phrase \"forgot password\". (We'll assume you see lots of tickets about forgotten passwords with this phrase.) This may not catch all of the tickets on this subject, but you might be able to head some off at the pass.<\/p>\r\n<p>To do something like that, go to the Triggers and mail notifications page under your Manage tab. There you'll see all the triggers currently configured in your Zendesk (we set up a few default ones when your account is created). You can edit or remove any of these to fit your needs.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also create new ones. Do this by clicking \"Add Trigger\" in the upper right.<\/p>\r\n<p>Zendesk can search incoming tickets for particular words or strings, so we can set up our trigger like so:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/zendesk.typepad.com\/.a\/6a00e0098d59f8883301347fb9f034970c-800wi\" border=\"0\" width=\"729\" height=\"591\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This tells our Zendesk to search any new tickets for the phrase \"forgot password\" and automatically send back a reply. You can also set the status of the ticket and any other relevant information.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is obviously a very simplistic example, but we hope it shows you the power of using Triggers. As we discussed in our tip about using Targets and setting up multiple support email addressees, triggers tie into many aspects of your Zendesk. They are there to help automate your support process, make sure you are responding to your tickets as efficiently as possible.<\/p>","updated_at":"2011\/03\/21 10:35:15 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":5,"id":160754,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":2851201,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":746,"created_at":"2010\/04\/22 09:57:49 -0700","title":"Mobile Access for Your Team and Your Customers","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["mobile-interface"],"body":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e0098d59f888330133ecd94fe8970b\" src=\"http:\/\/zendesk.typepad.com\/.a\/6a00e0098d59f888330133ecdb02a4970b-800wi\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 25px 25px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mobile-zendesk-home\" title=\"Mobile-zendesk-home\" width=\"160\" height=\"250\" align=\"right\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>One of the benefits of using web-based software is that you have access to it wherever and whenever you have access to the web.

Is it only via e-mail notification or are they able to login somehow?<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Just like you want to keep on top of you company\u2019s support requests, you also want your users to be able to keep up with their own tickets.  Zendesk gives them a couple ways to do this.<\/p>\r\n<p>Your end-users are notified as soon as they send a ticket to your Zendesk thanks to your pre-configured triggers.  By default, your end-users will also be notified when an agent replies with a public comment and when their ticket has been solved.  (We discussed the Zendesk default triggers in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/default-triggers-explained\">previous tip.<\/a>)  While your end-users can track their ticket progress via email notifications, they can also check on all their requests on your Zendesk support site.<\/p>\r\n<p>When your end-user receives a mail notification, they are prompted to go to your Zendesk (as seen below) to view the status of their ticket:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Help Your Customers Keep Track of Their Support Tickets\" title=\"image1.png\" width=\"478\" height=\"51\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Once at your Zendesk portal, your end-users can provide their email address and password and submit a new a request or, as in our case here, check their existing requests.  (Log out of your Zendesk to see these tabs.  If you don\u2019t see them, you need to check your user admission settings under the Account tab.)<\/p>\r\n<p>Once your end-user accesses the \u201ccheck your existing requests\u201d tab they will be able to see that either their request is \u201cbeing processed\u201d (i.e tickets marked new or open) or is \u201cawaiting their response\u201d (i.e for a ticket marked as pending).<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image01.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Help Your Customers Keep Track of Their Support Tickets\" title=\"image0.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"459\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, your end-users will have the option to create a follow-up ticket directly from any closed ticket from under the \u201ccheck your existing requests\u201d tab.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can check out how all this works by creating a test user account in your own Zendesk.  To do so go to the People page under the Manage tab.  Use this account any time you want to see what your customers see.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>","updated_at":"2011\/01\/17 17:58:45 -0800","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":403018,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":16002092,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":435,"created_at":"2011\/01\/17 17:53:00 -0800","title":"Default Triggers Explained","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["default_trigger_settings","triggers"],"body":"<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n<p><span class=\"zc-posting-info\">By <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/blog\/author\/jillthomas\/\" title=\"Posts by Jill Thomas\">Jill Thomas<\/a> on December 10, 2010<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Triggers are business rules that are automatically executed in response to certain events that have occurred on a particular ticket.  For instance, let\u2019s say you want to send an automatic email to a customer when you solve their ticket.  You set up a trigger to do that.<\/p>\r\n<p>Triggers are also extremely helpful in streamlining your help desk work-flow. Your Zendesk account comes with predefined triggers to allow you to engage with your end-users right away. Here\u2019s what you need to do to get started:<\/p>\r\n<p>From under the Manage tab &gt; Triggers &amp; Mail Notifications, you will find the below list of triggers.  Please note, that you can modify any of the outgoing mail notifications by selecting \u201cedit\u201d for any trigger.  Even if you don\u2019t plan on modifying any of the notifications, it\u2019s good idea to click edit into a few of them to get a sense of how triggers work.  To get a very in-depth look at triggers, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/21592-trigger-conditions-and-actions\">this article<\/a> on our support forums.<\/p>\r\n<p>The list of triggers below can be divided into 5 different help desk actions.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image0.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Default Triggers Explained\" title=\"image0.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"278\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>These actions include:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Notify the requester (i.e your end-user or client) of an action that took place on their ticket:   \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Notify requester of received request: <\/strong>will automatically notify an end-user as soon as their request has been turned into a ticket within your Zendesk.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Notify requester of a comment update:<\/strong> will update your end-user when a public comment has been posted to their ticket.  This means that your end-users will never be notified when a private, internal comment has been made to a ticket.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Notify requester of solved request:<\/strong> will alert your end-user that their ticket has been solved and invites the end-user to update the ticket with further information if needed.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>Notify the assignee (i.e agent) of an action that took place on a ticket that they are assigned to.   \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Notify assignee of comment update:<\/strong> will notify the agent assigned to a ticket when either a private or public comment has been added to their ticket by an end-user or an agent.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Notify assignee of assignment:<\/strong> will automatically alert your agents as soon as they have been assigned to a ticket.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Notify assignee of reopened ticket: <\/strong>will notify an agent that a ticket they marked as \u201csolved\u201d has been updated with a new comment.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>Notifying a group of agents of a new assignment.   \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Notify group of assignment:<\/strong> will alert all agents when a ticket has been assigned to a group that they are a member of.

If you run a help desk that serves different groups of people, you should try using <strong>Organizations<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Organizations give you another way to set up your support workflow.  Just like you can set up <strong>Triggers<\/strong> and other business rules based on things like keywords in a ticket, or how long it has gone unsolved, you can also trigger actions in Zendesk based on which Organization an end-user belongs to.<\/p>\r\n<p>For instance, say you support a software product that is used by several large companies.  Hundreds of people use your product within each of these companies; and you\u2019ve assigned each company a specific support agent.  Rather than manually checking every support ticket that comes in \u2014 seeing which company it came from and assigning it to the right agent \u2014 you could group each company\u2019s users into an Organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, when someone from Big Company A sends in a support ticket, your Zendesk can automatically assign it to the correct agent via a Trigger.  You can also see all the tickets that have come from a specific organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>To set up an organization go to <em>Manage<\/em> in the top navigation bar and choose <em>People<\/em>.  Choose <em>Add Organization<\/em> in the upper right and fill out the form.  Note that you can even automatically put users into an organization based on their email address.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/zendesk-organizations.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Organize Your Help Desk With Our Organizations Feature\" title=\"zendesk-organizations.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"236\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Another great feature of Organizations is the option (seen above) to make an organization shared to its users.  This means that when a user from an organization logs into your Zendesk, they can see all the tickets from that organization.  This is especially helpful for managers, or others who need to keep track of support from their end of things.<\/p>","updated_at":"2010\/12\/02 10:24:02 -0800","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":1,"posts_count":0,"id":347927,"forum_id":184361,"submitter_id":16002092,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":696,"created_at":"2010\/06\/28 12:14:12 -0700","title":"Escalate Community Topic to a Ticket","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["escalate","forums"],"body":"<p>One of the new Zendesk features available as part of our recently launched community support is the ability to escalate one of your community topics into a ticket.  This provides the opportunity to take a many-to-many interaction (customers talking to customers with your agents thrown in) and basically attach a one-to-one interaction to it.  Conversations (especially on the web) are dynamic entities that can take place on different levels at once.  Being able to turn a community topic into a ticket reflects that dynamism.  For instance, let's say you have a \"Feature Request\" forum on your Zendesk.  Users can suggest ideas for your product, and then you and other members of your community can publicly discuss.  Sometimes, however, you might want to discuss the idea internally without necessarily sharing that discussion publicly (need to talk about how their idea fits in with some upcoming other features that are not public yet).  In this case, you can use Zendesk to pull that topic into a ticket, discuss it privately among your agents, and when you are ready -- to announce that you are planning to adopt their idea -- post publicly back to the community forum <em>from within the ticket itself.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<h3>Setup<\/h3>\r\n<p>Since this feature relies on the recent Zendesk update to community support, you first need to enable the new forums in your account.  To do so, go to the <em>Personalize Your Zendesk<\/em> page under your <em>Account<\/em> tab.  Make sure the \"Enable new versions of forums?\" is checked.  Take advantage of all the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/163559-new-community-support-and-knowledge-base-sharing-features-how-it-works\">new forum features<\/a> available in your plan, including the ability to escalate a community topic-to-a-ticket.  (To check the features of your plan, refer to: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/compare\">http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/compare<\/a>.)  None of your current forums will be affected; they just now have access to the new functionality.  Zendesk Regular and Plus+ customers can now create three different types of community support forums: Articles, Questions, and Ideas.  (Starter plan customers can create Article forums only.)  As explained on our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/163559-new-community-support-and-knowledge-base-sharing-features-how-it-works\">support site<\/a>, <strong>Articles<\/strong> are for more static pieces of information such as a knowledge base article or an announcement; <strong>Questions<\/strong> allow your users to post a question about your product or service into the community; and <strong>Ideas<\/strong> give your community members a place to share feature requests or other feedback.  Once you've enabled the new forums, you can (as a Regular or Plus+ customer) convert your \"Feature Request\" forum to an <strong>Ideas<\/strong> forum.  To do so, simply go to your <em>Forum<\/em> tab in the top nav and then click through to that forum.  Once there, click the \"Edit\" link in the upper right.  Here, change the \"What kind of topics can be posted in the forum?\" drop down menu to Ideas.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/change-to-idea.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"change-to-idea\" width=\"620\" height=\"146\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Escalation in Action<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now, when a feature request is posted in this particular forum, you have the ability to escalate it.

It\u2019s ready?! Already! Wow! But how? I haven\u2019t done anything yet, I don\u2019t even know how to do anything yet!<\/p>\r\n<p>That\u2019s the great thing about Zendesk \u2013  all you need to do is choose an URL, and you\u2019ve got a help desk! You get to customize it, set nifty triggers, and post forum articles.  Not bad, not bad at all.<\/p>\r\n<p>Your Zendesk trial comes preloaded with the basics to get your help desk going right away, but what if you need help with your Zendesk? What if help desks are totally foreign to you? Or maybe you know what you\u2019re doing, but have a specific question? Where can you find answers?<\/p>\r\n<p>The first place to start is Zendesk\u2019s support portal.  You can access it by clicking the \u201cHelp\u201d link in the upper right-hand corner of your Zendesk, or directly at <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/support.zendesk.com<\/a>.  There you\u2019ll find a great variety of resources for everyone from newbies to old pros.  Let\u2019s see how it breaks down.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Become a Part of the Community<\/h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6598\" src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/Community-Help.png\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Community Help\" title=\"Community Help\" width=\"620\" height=\"233\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>We are really lucky to have an active community of Zendesk users. Joining the community and the conversation will give you insights into how other users are setting up their help desks, and hopefully help you come up with some ideas for your own.<\/p>\r\n<p>The community is also a place to ask questions \u2013 not only about Zendesk, but also about help desk workflow, tips, and tricks.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Forums<\/h4>\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/forums\" target=\"_blank\">Forums<\/a> are a goldmine of information. We keep our forums updated with Announcements, Known Issues, What\u2019s New, and Training materials. You can search for topics and vote on how helpful articles are.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Community Help<\/h4>\r\n<p>Sometimes, the best place to find an answer to your question is by asking those in the same place as you.  At our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/categories\/2-help-from-the-community\" target=\"_blank\">Community Help<\/a> forum, you can post a question and other Zendesk users will chime in with an answer (or further discussion). Our customer advocates keep an eye on this forum to make sure you\u2019re getting the answers you need, but we want to encourage Zendesk users to share their thoughts, which means you can get some wonderfully creative insights and ideas we might not have even thought of yet <img class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Zendesk Resources: Where to Get Help and Get Answers\" \/> .<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Ask Us A Question<\/h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6599\" src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/submit-a-request.png\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Zendesk Resources: Where to Get Help and Get Answers\" title=\"submit-a-request\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>If you have a specific issue or problem, you can contact our support directly.  At Zendesk, we don\u2019t have mere customer support, we have customer advocates! Hopefully you are now imagining us running around the office in capes\u2026but really, if you have a question, we want to answer it. If you have a problem, we want to help you fix it.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Support Tickets<\/h4>\r\n<p>Support tickets are there for when you run into a problem that just can\u2019t be answered. We\u2019ve got more information than you can shake a stick at in our forums, and they\u2019re the best place to start, but sometimes a question or problem might be so fantastically original that it needs its very own ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are three ways to start a support ticket online and if they seem familiar, it\u2019s because they are the very same options available to you on your Zendesk. First, you can click on the \u201cAsk Us\u201d dropbox on our front page at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.zendesk.com<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another option is to go through our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\">Support Portal<\/a>. You\u2019ll see a \u201cSubmit a request\u201d button in our menu bar. Simply click and voila!<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also just send an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@zendesk.com\">support@zendesk.com<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you submit a support ticket, it\u2019s super helpful if you can include some of your pertinent information, for instance, which Zendesk plan you\u2019re on, the number of the ticket your question might be about, and the email address associated with your account. If you choose to submit a ticket through our \u201cSubmit a request form,\u201d it will prompt you to include these points. But if you choose to simply send us an email or use our dropbox that information also helps us to answer you faster and more efficiently.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Note that One-On-One support is for our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/compare\">Regular and Plus+<\/a> customers.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Phone (Plus+ only)<\/h4>\r\n<p>We have phone support for our Plus+ customers (one of the perks of being Plus!)

Reach out to us there by at-replying us; and we\u2019ll create a ticket for your question.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Get Your Training On<\/h2>\r\n<p>One of the great things about Zendesk is how much you can do with it. You can customize your Zendesk, you can set up any number of integrations, you can play with our API, but you might need a little help and that\u2019s where training comes in. We\u2019ve got webinars and video tutorials set up to help you along at whatever level you\u2019re at.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Webinars<\/h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/webinars\" target=\"_blank\">Webinars<\/a> are live online presentations where we present topics and attendees can ask questions or simply listen in. We run Zendesk 101 webinars for beginners every Tuesday from 10 to 11a.m. PDT. If you are already a user, we also have Zendesk 201, which focuses on helping you really leverage the power of your Zendesk. And you can even catch up with all that\u2019s happened by tuning in to What\u2019s New at Zendesk, the last Wednesday of every month.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are also prerecorded webinars you can check out at your leisure. To register for a webinar, or listen to a prerecorded webinar, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/webinars\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/webinars<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Video Tutorials<\/h4>\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/categories\/5-video-tutorials\" target=\"_blank\">video tutorials<\/a> are another option if you\u2019re looking for information in a presentation format.  If you\u2019re just getting started or training a new agent, these are a great way to dive into what your Zendesk can do.<\/p>\r\n<p>For newbies, we recommend getting started with <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/163439-ticket-basics\" target=\"_blank\">Ticket Basics<\/a>. Tickets are the backbone of your help desk and making sure you understand how ticketing works will make life a lot easier.<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you\u2019re confident about getting support tickets into Zendesk, it\u2019s time to think about organization and workflow.

One of the goals when following ITIL is to streamline the communication channel.  To accomplish this, a framework is set up so that if a Level 1 agent is unable to solve a ticket, the ticket can quickly and easily be passed on to advanced support.  At Zendesk, we want to keep our resolution time down. This approach allows us to receive all tickets within one central clearinghouse and, when a ticket requires advanced technical knowledge, escalate the tickets to Level 2.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to follow an escalation workflow, we use Groups within Zendesk.  Groups allow you to organize your agents according to the types of tickets you would like to assign them.  At Zendesk we have Groups for Level 1 and Level 2 support (which break down how technical the questions are from our customers); but we also have a Development group (for bugs and other product related issues), Marketing group (for sales opportunities), and others.<\/p>\r\n<p>Groups can be added and changed easily, so it\u2019s best to let them adapt as your support grows and evolves.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Adding Groups<\/h2>\r\n<p>To add a Group to your Zendesk, simply go to the \u201cmanage\u201d tab in the top navbar and select \u201cpeople.\u201d On the next page, select add \u201cgroup\u201d from the upper right.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image01.jpg\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Adding Groups\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Escalating Your Tickets With Groups\" width=\"620\" height=\"104\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you have selected \u201cadd group\u201d you will need to name your Group and select which agents will be members of this Group.  With this in place, a \u201cgroup\u201d ticket field will automatically appear in your tickets (see below).<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image2.jpg\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Group field added to ticket\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Escalating Your Tickets With Groups\" width=\"620\" height=\"175\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Using Groups<\/h2>\r\n<p>To set up tiered support (e.g. Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, etc.), you will want one group (Level 1) to see all the tickets that come in to your support email address (e.g. support@yourdomain.zendesk.com) or through your support portal.  To do this, a basic Trigger can be used to assign new tickets to the Level 1 group.  (You\u2019ll find Triggers under the Manage tab.)<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image1.jpg\" border=\"1\" alt=\"Group Trigger\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Escalating Your Tickets With Groups\" width=\"620\" height=\"421\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>A Level 1 support agent can then review the ticket and either assign it to themselves if they can answer it, or escalate to Level 2.  Note that you can escalate a ticket to a Group without assigning it to a specific agent.  This allows you to notify the whole Group that a new ticket has been escalated to them, ensuring that every agent is kept alert of the tickets coming in.<\/p>\r\n<p>To do this in Zendesk, create a Trigger that sends an email to the Group based on these conditions:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/private\/wp-content\/uploads\/image3.jpg\" border=\"1\" alt=\"group assignment\" title=\"Tip of the Week: Escalating Your Tickets With Groups\" width=\"620\" height=\"213\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To speed things up you can also create a macro for Level 1 agents to use when they need to assign a ticket to Level 2.

When you enable customer satisfaction rating, by default, end-users receive an       email 24 hours after the ticket has been set to solved that asks one simple question with two       possible answers, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_bmk_qgc_fc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/w1f15pgh41zifcj\/?name=csr_question.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"csr_question.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The survey is designed to maximize the response rate by being quick and simple while also       gathering the essential data: a positive or negative rating.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span>&nbsp;This feature is available to Regular and Plus+ accounts.&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Logging in not required to rate tickets<\/h2>\r\n<p class=\"p\">End-users do not have to be logged in to the help desk to rate their tickets. Clicking a       response link in the email opens a temporary URL to the ticket and prompts the end-user to       rate the ticket and add a comment if they'd like, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_xhc_pee_fc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/gsbgufzsctatwip\/?name=csr_rate_from_link.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"csr_rate_from_link.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">In this example, the end-user clicked the 'Good, I'm satisfied' link so the Good button is       shaded green to indicate that it is the selected rating. A comment can be added and the rating       can be changed.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_tcq_ife_fc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/tf5mgggcbbh9shd\/?name=csr_rated.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"csr_rated.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The temporary survey link only works once, so end-users can't click it again from the email       to change their rating; however, they can change their rating while logged in to the help       desk. The rating prompt is shown on all solved tickets in the help desk. So, your end-users       can rate tickets without logging in or when they are logged in.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Ratings can be changed until the ticket is closed.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">Additionally, the following rules apply to end-users when using satisfaction rating:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_znd_qyd_fc\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_znd_qyd_fc\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">End-users cannot opt-out of receiving survey requests. <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Satisfaction rating is per ticket, not per customer. End-users receive a survey           request for each of their tickets that are solved. <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">When and how end-users are asked for a satisfaction rating via email is customizable. You       don't have to send the request 24 hours after the ticket is solved, you can set a different       time. Also, you can add the survey request in the email that is sent when a ticket is solved,       rather than sending a separate email x number of hours later. You can also use business rules       to be more selective about which tickets generate the survey request.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_zcl_lsd_fc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_zcl_lsd_fc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Sending the survey request<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">When you (an admin) enable satisfaction rating (see <a href=\"#topic_dwy_gyv_cc\" class=\"xref\">Enabling customer satisfaction rating<\/a>), a system generated automation         called <strong>Request customer satisfaction rating<\/strong> is added to your help desk. This         automation sends the survey email 24 hours after the ticket is solved. You can of course         customize this.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">The email body in the automation uses a placeholder called {{satisfaction.rating_section}}         to insert the survey question into the message, as shown         here:\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">Hello {{ticket.requester.name}}, \r\n \r\nWe'd love to hear what you think of our customer service. Please take a moment to answer one simple question below:\r\n \r\n{{satisfaction.rating_section}} \r\n \r\nHere's a reminder of what your ticket was about: {{ticket.comments_formatted}}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">When customers receive the email, they simply click either the Good or Bad links and follow         the steps described above.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">For more details about the automation, see <a href=\"#topic_dze_ubw_cc\" class=\"xref\">Customer satisfaction rating automation<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_qfu_kvd_fc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_qfu_kvd_fc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Use a trigger instead of the automation<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Rather than use the automation to send the survey, you can deactivate it and use the         {{satisfaction.rating_section}} placeholder in a trigger instead. You'd most likely add the         survey request to your 'solved' trigger. The default 'solved' trigger in Zendesk is called           <strong>Notify requester of solved request<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">All you have to do is add the {{satisfaction.rating_section}} placeholder to the email         body, as in this         eaxmple:\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">Your request (#{{ticket.id}}) has been deemed solved.\r\n \r\nTo review, comment and reopen the request, follow the link below:\r\nhttp:\/\/{{ticket.url}}\r\n \r\nWe'd love to hear what you think of our customer service. Please take a moment to answer one simple question below:\r\n \r\n{{satisfaction.rating_section}} \r\n \r\n{{ticket.comments_formatted}}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Using the solved trigger for the survey request means one less email to the end-user, if         that's a concern for you. Using the automation and a separate email may yield better results         because it is the focus of the email, not just an addition to the solved email.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> Rating a ticket does not change its status; it's not reopened or in any other way           modified aside from capturing the rating.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_twa_svd_fc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_twa_svd_fc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">How agents receive the satisfaction rating feedback<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">The results of customer satisfaction rating are shown in the help desk, in the agent's         dashboard, and in a view called <strong>Rated tickets from the last 7 days<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Agents see, in their dashboard, the number of good and bad tickets for the last week and         the overall satisfaction rating for the agent and the entire help desk over the last 60         days.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> You must have the agent dashboard enabled to see the customer satisfaction ratings. An           admin can do this by selecting <strong>Settings &gt; Agents &gt; Agent Dashboard<\/strong> and deselecting           the <strong>Hide<\/strong> option.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_twa_svd_fc__image_far_qlc_fc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/i0mbl45gc4reypo\/?name=csr_agent_dashboard_new.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"csr_agent_dashboard_new.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The calculation of the overall satisfaction rating uses the following simple formula:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_twa_svd_fc__image_gfo_tec_fc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/tczone9lpisbx01\/?name=csr_score_calculation.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"csr_score_calculation.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">This means that the score is an average of the total positive ratings from the past 60         days. An agent with a score of 90% means that over the past 60 days, 90% of the ratings they         received were positive.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Agents, groups, and the account all have scores. The help desk score (in the example above,         93%) is the average for all agents in the help desk. The two ratings provide feedback about         individual performance and the average performance of all agents in the help desk.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> An overall rating score will not be shown until 30 tickets are rated. This applies at           the agent, group, and account levels. This means that an agent needs 30 ratings, a group           (all agents within the group) needs 30 ratings, and the account (all agents in the help           desk) needs 30 ratings.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The new view (<strong>Rated tickets from the last 7 days<\/strong>) gives you a quick overview of the         rating activity, with a Satisfaction column containing both Good and Bad ratings. You can of         course clone and modify this view or create your own.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The following rules apply to agents when using customer satisfaction rating:<a name=\"topic_twa_svd_fc__ul_plq_hae_fc\"><\/a><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<ul id=\"topic_twa_svd_fc__ul_plq_hae_fc\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Agents cannot rate tickets, unless they are the requester. <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">All agents see their ratings in their dashboard.

You cannot exclude individual             agents from receiving ratings on the tickets they are assigned to. <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Additionally, ratings cannot be moderated.

Reports are detailed snapshots       of collections of tickets within a time period.

Views are essential for managing the ticket workflow because they       allow you to create meaningful groupings of tickets as they come in to the help desk and as       they are managed through to resolution.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Many help desks use views to guide the workflow by requiring agents to address tickets in one       view first and then others in a specific order. Views can also mirror the support structure       you've created. For example, if you provide different levels of service for different       customers or manage escalation using a tiered support group structure (Level 1, Level 2), you       can create views for every one of these scenarios.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">Zendesk provides you with a set of views for the essential day-to-day running of your help       desk. These include:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_iuq_hfv_ec\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_iuq_hfv_ec\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">My unsolved tickets<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Unassigned tickets<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">All unsolved tickets<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Recently updated tickets<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Unsolved tickets in your groups<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">New tickets in your groups<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Pending tickets<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Recently solved tickets<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can use these views as is, modify them, or deactivate them.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Views, like other business rules such as triggers and automations, use conditions to define a       set of tickets. Once you've created a view based on conditions, you've got a list of tickets       that meets that criteria.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_ngv_kiq_hc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/mkjeul2gjsp10bx\/?name=views_table_example.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"views_table_example.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Views can be displayed as a table (shown above) and as a list, which simply shows the ticket       title and the most recent comment. When viewing tickets in a table, positioning your mouse       over a ticket title displays essential data about it, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_cnn_flq_hc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/becfapscrptrtqf\/?name=views_ticket_hover.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"views_ticket_hover.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Also, when viewing tickets in the table format you can select one or more tickets and update       them in the view, as in this example:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_fjk_mmq_hc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/scfz5ww5nnm8fgs\/?name=views_update_tickets.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"views_update_tickets.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Views are created and can be managed by selecting <strong>Manage &gt; Views<\/strong>. This is available to       both admins and agents. Quick access to views is available by clicking the <strong>View<\/strong> tab in       the menu bar.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_epm_xhv_ec\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/eynsoz76gfyejbu\/?name=views_menu.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"views_menu.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The <strong>View<\/strong> tab displays the first 12 of your shared views and 8 of your own views. If       you have more views than this, the rest of your views can be quickly accessed by clicking the         <strong>More<\/strong> link at the bottom of the list. You can select the views you want to include in       the <strong>View<\/strong> tab by setting the order of the views on the <strong>Manage &gt; Views<\/strong> page.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Aside from the standard help desk views and the views you add yourself, Zendesk may add new       views when features are added to the help desk. For example, enabling customer satisfaction       rating adds a view. If you use SLA service targets, you'll also see those available as views       in the <strong>Views<\/strong> tab.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> A Views widget is also available that you can add to many pages of the help desk. See           <a href=\"#topic_ryf_vyn_gc\" class=\"xref\">Adding the Ticket Views widget<\/a>.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Like macros, there are two kinds of views, shared and personal. Admins can create shared views       and agents can create their own (personal) views. Shared views can be made available to all       agents or agents in a specific group.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_vcr_xfp_ec\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_vcr_xfp_ec\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Adding views<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Admins can create shared views and agents can create their own (personal) views.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><strong>To add a view<\/strong><a name=\"topic_vcr_xfp_ec__ol_fgf_oym_gc\"><\/a><ol id=\"topic_vcr_xfp_ec__ol_fgf_oym_gc\" class=\"ol\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Select <strong>Manage &gt; Views<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Click <strong>Add New<\/strong>. <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Add the conditions you want to select a collection of tickets (conditions are             described below). <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">You can test the conditions by selecting <strong>Preview match for the conditions             above<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Set the formatting options (described below). <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Set the view's availability (described below). <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Click <strong>Create<\/strong>. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol><\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Views can be managed (edited, deactivated, and so on) in <strong>Manage &gt; Views<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_tpp_zfp_ec\" class=\"topic nested2\"><a name=\"topic_tpp_zfp_ec\"><\/a>\r\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">Building view condition statements<\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">As with the other business rules, you select collections of tickets using conditions,           operators, and values.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"tablenoborder\"><a name=\"topic_tpp_zfp_ec__table_jvc_fhp_ec\"><\/a> \r\n<table id=\"topic_tpp_zfp_ec__table_jvc_fhp_ec\" class=\"table\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" frame=\"border\" rules=\"all\">\r\n<caption><span class=\"tablecap\">Table 1.

account.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Salesforce edition support<\/h2>\r\n<p>The ability to view Zendesk tickets from Salesforce is available for Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited and Developer editions. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Due to restrictions in enabling remote access apps on Professional, the ability to lookup Salesforce information and create cases from tickets in Salesforce Professional <strong>requires adding API access to your Professional Edition organization. <\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Getting started<\/h2>\r\n<p>Follow these steps and begin using Zendesk for

Enterprise, Unlimited and Developer organizations.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>If you use Salesforce as your customer system of record, Zendesk gives your support agents access to important customer details stored in Salesforce. &nbsp;Zendesk can retrieve user information from Salesforce using the user's primary e-mail address on the user's Zendesk profile. &nbsp;This information displays in the requester profile on ticket pages and the user's profile page. &nbsp;The Salesforce administrator has full control over which Salesforce record types are shown in Zendesk, including which fields are returned.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Important:<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Zendesk will cache Salesforce information on a user's profile for 24 hours before attempting to retrieve new information.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Mapping record types and fields<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Available record types and field types<\/h3>\r\n<p>Your Salesforce administrator must explicitly select record types along with fields from each record type to show in Zendesk. &nbsp;Any Salesforce record type, including custom types, can be selected. &nbsp;For each record type, any standard or custom field can be chosen.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Rules for matching Salesforce records<\/h3>\r\n<p>When Zendesk queries Salesforce for records related to a Zendesk user, Salesforce will return results as follows:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Direct match: &nbsp;<\/strong>For all selected record types, return selected fields where the Zendesk user's email address exactly matches the email address field on the mapped record type. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>By default, Lead and Contact records are matched using the standard email field. &nbsp;Other record types can define an appropriate email field.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Match through lookup relationship:<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;For all matched records that have selected lookup relationship fields, return selected fields for the record referenced in the lookup relationship field. &nbsp;This ability will allow Zendesk agents to see data which may not exist on a directly matched record.<\/p>\r\n<h3>An example<\/h3>\r\n<p>Configuring and understanding the flexibility of looking up Salesforce data above is best explained through an example. &nbsp;Suppose that your Zendesk agents want the following Salesforce records and fields available when viewing a ticket:<\/p>\r\n<table style=\"width: 400px;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Salesforce record type<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Record fields<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact<\/td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Business phone<br

date<br \/>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In this example, suppose that an Account's contract is referenced in a lookup relationship field on the Account record by a field named <strong>Current Contract<\/strong>:<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ifmzgfgwrl58gre\/?name=zd4sfdc-gsg-user-lookup-setup-08.jpg\"

Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Configuring mapped record types and fields<\/h3>\r\n<p>Let's use the above example to demonstrate how to select record types and fields in Salesforce to retrieve the desired information in Zendesk.<\/p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;In Salesforce, navigate to the application dropdown in the upper-right corner of your screen and select <strong>Zendesk for

alt=\"zd4sfdc-gsg-user-lookup-setup-07.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;Scroll to the <strong>Mapped record types <\/strong>section on the <strong>Zendesk<\/strong>&nbsp;tab. &nbsp;By default, Contact, Account and Lead record types are available.<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"

fields list, select&nbsp;<strong>Business Phone<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;In the available Account fields list, select&nbsp;<strong>Employees<\/strong> and <strong>Annual Revenue <\/strong>and

alt=\"zd4sfdc-gsg-user-lookup-setup-10.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;In this example, it's important to note that since <strong>Current Contract<\/strong>&nbsp;is references a <strong>Contract<\/strong>, we must specify what fields should be mapped from the <strong>Contract<\/strong> record type.<\/p>\r\n<p>6. &nbsp;Since <strong>Contract<\/strong> is not an available

<strong>Save<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>10. &nbsp;Your record type and fields are now properly selected to directly match a Contact in Salesforce and indirectly match an Account and any Contract referenced

Otherwise, proceed to the next section called <em>Setup user data lookup<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Advanced configuration for SugarCRM Accounts (optional)<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are two ways to leverage the Zendesk Organization a name as a lookup entity to match Zendesk tickets to a SugarCRM Account.&nbsp; First, you can specify a Zendesk Organization name which will override the email-based lookup for each Account (if no name is specified, then the lookup will use the email address of the Contacts within the Account).&nbsp; The second option is for SugarCRM to automatically match Account and Organization names (if no match exist, then it will not try to match on using email address of Contacts).&nbsp; For a full discussion about the matching process, please read our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20179256-zendesk-for-sugarcrm-faq\"><em>Zendesk for SugarCRM<\/em> FAQ<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>To set up the first option, you need to add a Zendesk organization field, which should be given the name zendesk_organization. The field needs to be added to the <em>Edit Layout<\/em> and when this field has a value on an Account, this will override the normal routine and will use just that name as the organization name to query tickets.

When this happens, an alert is displayed at the top of         the ticket (this alert is also displayed in views that are formatted as tables).

An admin can choose to include the placeholder {{agent.signature}} in the         template (Settings &gt; Agents) to enable agents to add their own signatures.

This is referred to as 'assuming a         user'. This allows agents to troubleshoot help desk issues (for example, why a trigger or         automation isn't working). Agents can then easily revert back to their own identity.

Where they differ is that automations run when a time event occurs (from one hour to         28 days) after a ticket property was set or updated, rather than immediately after a ticket         is created or updated.

You can create         an unlimited number of categories and order them on the forums page as needed.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_kdb_jir_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_kdb_jir_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Channels<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<div class=\"p\">Channels are the ways that you can engage with your customers (how they create support         requests and how you communicate with them). All channel communication is recorded on         tickets. You choose and configure the channels you want your help desk to support. Channels           include:<a name=\"topic_kdb_jir_yb__ul_tsa_vkr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<ul id=\"topic_kdb_jir_yb__ul_tsa_vkr_yb\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Email<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Web portal<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Twitter<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Chat<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Voice<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Zendesk Dropbox<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Zendesk API<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">To set up channels, select <strong>Settings &gt; Channels<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_rue_hdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_rue_hdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Comment<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">When a ticket request is submitted it contains a subject and a decription. All followup         communication on the ticket is contained in comments. Agents add comments, macros and         triggers and automation can add comments, and the requester can add comments. There are two         types of comment: public and private. Everyone, including those CC'd on a ticket, can see         public comments but only support staff can see private comments.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_dng_nrq_cc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_dng_nrq_cc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Current user<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Current user is a reference to the last person who updated the ticket, which is             not necessarily the same person who is assigned to the ticket. The current user (whoever             updated the ticket last) changes whenever the ticket is updated. And, the update may             have been made by the assignee, the requester, or someone who was CC'd on the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_fmg_jdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_fmg_jdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Customer<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">This is often used interchangeably with end-user. See End-user.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_ptv_kdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_ptv_kdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Dashboard<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">A dashboard is an area of the help desk that displays summary information and vital         statistics for the user. For example, the agent dashboard is displayed at the top of the         home page when an agent logs in and it contains vital statistics such as the number of open         tickets assigned both to the agent and the agent's groups.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_iyk_mdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_iyk_mdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Dropbox<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">The dropbox is a tab that can be added to any web page. It's an embeddable tool that allows         users to quickly submit requests, search the forums, request a chat, and so on, without         having to log in to the Zendesk Web portal.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_mgd_odr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_mgd_odr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Email forwarding<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">When you set up a Zendesk account, your help desk is given a default email address that         customers can use to submit support requests. Many accounts prefer to use their own email         addresses rather than use the Zendesk provided address. You can use email forwarding to         accept email at your own address (for example, help@mycompany.com) and then forward it to         your Zendesk address (support@mycompany.zendesk.com). You can also forward any prefix to         @mycompany.zendesk.com and then set up triggers and automations from there.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_kly_pdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_kly_pdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Email notifications<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Email notifications can be generated via a trigger or automation when a ticket is updated.         Common notifications include a new public comment added to the ticket or a change to the         ticket status.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_ewv_rdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_ewv_rdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">End-user<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">End-user refers to people who generate support requests from any of the             available support channels (Web portal, email, Twitter, etc.). End-users do not have             access to any of the admin and agent features of the help desk. They can only submit and             track tickets and communicate with agents publicly (meaning their comments can never be             private). End-users may also be referred to as customers. For more information about             user roles, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20055812-understanding-help-desk-user-roles\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Understanding help desk user roles<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_eok_tdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_eok_tdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Forums<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Forums, when not used in the general sense, refers to the second level of organization         after categories. Forums contain articles. Each forum can be assigned to only one category.         You can assign viewing permissions to forums. For example, forums can be viewable by         everyone, only logged in users, only agents, or only specified organizations. You can also         control moderation, forum content types (articles, ideas, and questions), and who can         contribute content.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_bcd_vdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_bcd_vdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Group<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Groups are used to create collections of agents. How you define groups is entirely up to         you. You might create groups by skill (software vs hardware) or to reflect the organizations         they serve (for example, a support group might serve only customers in a certain region or         time zone). Agents can belong to more than one group. End-users cannot be added to groups,         only organizations. For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20050286-about-organizations-and-groups\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">About organizations and groups<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20047256-creating-managing-and-using-groups\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Creating, managing, and using groups<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_nwr_wdr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_nwr_wdr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Group stations<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">This refers to the number of groups that have successively been assigned to a ticket. This         is used as a condition in triggers.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_qbi_ydr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_qbi_ydr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Host mapping<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Host mapping (also referred to as domain mapping) is the ability to map your default         Zendesk domain URL to a different URL. For example, rather than using         http:\/\/support.mycompany.zendesk.com you may want your help desk URL to contain your         company's name, like this: http:\/\/support.mycompany.com. You need to configure this with         your domain provider.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_ebj_ber_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_ebj_ber_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Macro<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">A macro is a prepared response or action that agents can use to quickly respond to support         requests that can be answered with a standard response or to modify a ticket. Macros contain         actions, which can be updates to ticket properties. Agents manually apply macros when they         are creating or updating tickets. Macros can also be organized into categories to help         agents quickly locate them. For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011363-creating-ticket-handling-shortcuts-with-macros\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Creating ticket handling shortcuts with macros<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_xeb_der_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_xeb_der_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Non-restricted agents<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">A non-restricted agent is an agent who has access to all tickets. In other             words, they have not been restricted to only the group or groups to which they belong,             the organization they belong to, or to the tickets they have been assigned to. The             ability to refer to these agents may be useful when creating triggers.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_jft_eer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_jft_eer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Operator<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">An operator is sometimes used to refer to an agent. This term has been deprecated. Please         use agent instead.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_iri_ger_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_iri_ger_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Organization<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Organizations are collections of users (agents and end-users). How you set up your         organizations is entirely up to you. Agents and end-users can be added to only one         organization. Once you create them, you can use organizations throughout the help desk to         define views, as criteria for assigning tickets, as conditions in automations and triggers,         to define access to forums, and in your reports. For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20050286-about-organizations-and-groups\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">About organizations and groups<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20049342-creating-managing-and-using-organizations\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Creating, managing, and using organizations<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_oou_her_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_oou_her_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Owner<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">The account owner is a type of admin. The account name is associated with this             person's name, usually the person who created the account. There can only be one account             owner; however, account ownership can be reassigned by the account owner to another             admin if needed. The account owner has access to areas of the help desk that other             admins do not, such as invoicing, payment options, and benchmarking for the account. For             more information about user roles, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20055812-understanding-help-desk-user-roles\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Understanding help desk user roles<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_oil_jer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_oil_jer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Placeholders<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Placeholders are references to ticket and user data that you include in the subject and         text of email notifications. Without placeholders it would be impossible to create automatic         notifications. You'd have to manually enter this data for each ticket. Placeholders are         contained in double curly brackets, like this: {{ticket.assignee.name}}. You can view the         list of available system placeholders in the help desk when creating macros (for example).         Custom fields can also be referenced as placeholders. For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011631-using-placeholders\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Using placeholders<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_tsk_ler_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_tsk_ler_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Priority<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Each ticket is assigned a priority. There are four values for priority: Low, Normal, High,         and Urgent. The ticket priority is used throughout the help desk to generate views and         reports and it's also used as conditions and actions in automations and triggers and as         actions in macros.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_eic_ner_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_eic_ner_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Remote authentication<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Remote authentication is one of the two Single Sign-On services available in Zendesk. The         other is SAML. See Single Sign-On.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_urw_oer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_urw_oer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Requester<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Requester refers to the person who made the support request. Requester is used             throughout the help desk (including macros, views, automations, triggers, and reports)             to refer to the person who generated the support request.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_kmq_qer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_kmq_qer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">SAML<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Secure Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is one of the two Single Sign-On services available         for remotely authenticating users, the other is Remote Authentication. SAML allows you to         provide Single Sign-on (SSO) for your help desk using enterprise identity types such as         Active Directory and LDAP.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_zpr_ret_bc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_zpr_ret_bc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Shared organization<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">A shared organization refers to allowing all users within an organization to see all of the         organization's tickets and, optionally, allowing those users to comment on each other's         tickets. An admin can set up shared organizations (it's an option available when creating or         editing an organization). You also have the option of granting this privilege to select         end-users instead. You set this up in the user's profile. See <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20049342-creating-managing-and-using-organizations#topic_nat_vgn_bc\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Shared organization for end-users<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_ppu_ser_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_ppu_ser_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Single Sign-On<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Single Sign-On refers to a security option in Zendesk that allows you to authenticate users         remotely, which means that it is handled outside of Zendesk. You can use remote         authentication or SAML authentication. When users attempt to log in to Zendesk their login         request is routed to a remote authentication or SAML service to authenticate the user's         credentials. When verified, users are redirected back to Zendesk and logged in.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_onp_uer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_onp_uer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">SLA (Service Level Agreement) service targets<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Service Level Agreements, or SLA\u2019s are typically an agreed upon measurement of the average         response and resolution times that your support delivers to your customers. Providing         support based on service levels ensures that you are delivering measured and predictable         service, and have greater visibility when there are problems. SLA Service Targets in Zendesk         can be defined so you and your agents can better monitor your service level performance and         meet your service level goals.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_zye_wer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_zye_wer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Status<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Each ticket is assigned a status. There are five values for status: New, Open, Pending,         Solved, Closed. The ticket status is used throughout the help desk to generate views and         reports and it's also used as a condition in automations, macros, and triggers. The status         can only be changed to closed via automations and triggers (not manually).<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_ezx_xer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_ezx_xer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Tag<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">To help you categorize, act on, or search for tickets and forum articles, you can add tags.         Tags can be added to tickets automatically based on the words in the request, manually by         agents, or via triggers, automations, and macros. Once added, you can create views by tags,         search for tags and the tickets in which they are included, and use tags in your triggers,         automations, and macros. For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011393-using-tags\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Using tags<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_lxz_zer_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_lxz_zer_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Target<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">There may be times when you want to notify an external system about a new ticket or an         important state change to a ticket (for example, send a message when a high priority ticket         has not been resolved after a specified amount of time). By setting up external targets you         can communicate with many cloud-based applications and services (such as Twitter and Twilio)         as well as HTTP and email. For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20012047-notifying-external-targets\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Notifying external targets<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_qpp_bfr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_qpp_bfr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Trigger<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Creating or updating tickets in Zendesk generates events. You can use these events to         automatically modify tickets and send email notifications. For example, when a new ticket is         created Zendesk sends an email confirmation to the person who generated the ticket (the         requester). The mechanism that enables this is called a trigger. Using triggers, you can         also automatically assign a ticket to a specific support agent or support group based on the         email address it was sent to, the organization to which the requester belongs, or keywords         contained in the request message.

There are four values for type: Question, Incident,         Problem, Task. The ticket type is used throughout the help desk to generate views and         reports and it's also used as a condition in automations, macros, and triggers.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_oyv_efr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_oyv_efr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">View<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Views define a collection of tickets based on a set of criteria (expressed as conditions).         Views can be formatted to be displayed as lists or tables and you can specify who can access         them. You create and use views to define collections of tickets such as \"My open tickets\" or         \"Recently solved tickets\" for example.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_vqi_ssz_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_vqi_ssz_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Web portal<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">This refers to the parts of the help desk application that are available to end-users to         submit tickets, track their support requests, and access your knowledge base and forums.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_xci_gfr_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_xci_gfr_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Whitelist<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">The whitelist is used to allow email to be received from specific email domains and         addresses. It is used along with the blacklist to, for example, allow email from a specific         address in a blacklisted domain to be accepted into the help desk (and not suspended).

You can         add widgets into the help desk (they are displayed in the right side of your help desk         pages) for a number of popular cloud-based applications and services such as Salesforce and         Google Analytics or you can create your own custom widgets.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/09 15:29:54 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":4,"posts_count":2,"id":517021,"forum_id":389941,"submitter_id":28633492,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":818,"created_at":"2011\/04\/07 08:47:44 -0700","title":"Streamlining workflow with ticket updates and triggers","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["triggers"],"body":"<!--?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?-->\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/n6hghytvtka4qrh\/?name=zug_watermark.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"zug_watermark.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Triggers are business rules you define that run immediately after tickets are created or       updated. For example, a trigger can be used to notify the customer when a ticket has been       opened. Another can be created to then notify the customer when the ticket is solved.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Only admins can create and manage triggers.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Triggers contain <em>conditions<\/em> and <em>actions<\/em>. You combine these to create \u2018if\u2019 and       \u2018then\u2019 statements (<em>if<\/em> the ticket contains a certain set of conditions <em>then<\/em> the       actions make the desired updates to the ticket and optionally notify the requester or the       support staff). You build condition and action statements using ticket properties, field       operators, and the ticket property values.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">There are two types of conditions \u2013 <em>all<\/em> conditions and <em>any<\/em> conditions. The         <em>all<\/em> conditions, as you\u2019ve probably already figured out, must all be true. If any of       the condition statements fail (are not true), the trigger will not act on the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_cgc_fcb_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ichliywvovep2nc\/?name=triggers_all_conditions.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"triggers_all_conditions.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Additionally at least one of the <em>any<\/em> conditions must also be true. For example, you       might want a trigger to act only on tickets that are submitted from a list of specific email       addresses, as in this example:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_kbn_dcb_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/rmzyw4sbxfn7os4\/?name=trigger_any_conditions.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"trigger_any_conditions.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If either of these conditions is true, the trigger will fire. If you use only one condition       in the <em>any<\/em> section, it will behave like an <em>all<\/em> condition and therefore must be       true for the trigger to fire.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Action statements follow the same format, but rather than testing for conditions to be true       or not, actions set ticket properties and send email notifications, as in this example:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_lpz_lcb_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/xjhouodshfagnxw\/?name=trigger_actions.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"trigger_actions.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Each time a ticket is created or updated <em>all<\/em> of your triggers run; therefore, as       you\u2019re creating triggers you need to think about the order of triggers because an action in       one trigger may change a ticket property that was changed by another trigger. If you're not       careful, this can result in multiple email notifications being sent, which can create       confusion for your customers.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_usx_vxx_tb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_usx_vxx_tb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Zendesk triggers to get you started<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">To help you get started with triggers, Zendesk provides you with a set of triggers and mail         notifications that are best practices in a typical help desk workflow.

The words in the request         are scanned and compared to and weighted against existing tags and their recent use. From         that, three words are selected from the request and are added as tags. In other words, if         the request contains frequently used words that are already in your tag cloud, those are         the tags that will be added to the request. If the request contains words that are not         already in the tag cloud, the three most frequently used words in the request become new         tags. This can sometimes result in tags being created for non-essential high-frequency words         ('the', 'a', 'this', and so on) because there is no exclusion list. For this reason, if you         have a high volume of requests, you may want to disable automatic tagging and use manual         tagging instead.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_hzh_zka_vb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_hzh_zka_vb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Setting tagging options<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Automatic tagging is enabled by default, but you can disable automatic tagging if you\u2019d         like (see <em>Understanding automatic tagging<\/em> above).<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><strong>To disable\/enable automatic ticket tagging<\/strong><a name=\"topic_hzh_zka_vb__ol_usr_cla_vb\"><\/a><ol id=\"topic_hzh_zka_vb__ol_usr_cla_vb\" class=\"ol\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Select <strong>Settings &gt; Tickets<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">In the <strong>Tags<\/strong> section of the settings tab, deselect the <strong>Enable automatic               ticket tagging<\/strong> option. <\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Click <strong>Save Changes<\/strong>. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol><\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If you disable automatic tagging, you can still add tags manually.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can also turn off manual tagging (the tags input field will not be displayed on the new         ticket screen).

Using the help desk search         box, enter the name of the tag and the search results will display all the tickets and forum         articles that contain the tag. Tag matches are ranked higher than matches from the content         in titles and comments. For example, if you use a tag called \u2018installation\u2019 a search for         that tag returns the tickets or articles that contain that tag first, followed by results         that contain occurrences of the word \u2018\u2019installation\u2019 in titles and comments.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">You can further improve your search results for tags by using property keywords in your         searches.

They can be used to attach additional data to your tickets, which you can         then use in your automations, macros, and triggers.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">As an example, let\u2019s look at how a tag can be used in a trigger. If you use email         subdomains, you may have set up a subdomain to track the tickets that are generated through         responses to your newsletter. You can set up a trigger to check for the origin of the ticket         using the <strong>Ticket received at<\/strong> condition, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_umd_ona_vb__image_hbb_bxp_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ljzjmwzlmqidjsn\/?name=tag_in_trigger_new.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tag_in_trigger_new.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can then add an action that adds a tag to the ticket, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_umd_ona_vb__image_whp_qwp_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ud1syppmk1cznlu\/?name=tag_as_trigger_action_new.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tag_as_trigger_action_new.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can then use this tag to create a view that shows you all the tickets that have been         created from newsletter responses. You can also use the tag as a condition or an action in         some other automation, macro, or trigger. For example you might want to exclude this tag for         some reason when you\u2019re defining the selection of tickets you want to be acted on by a         trigger, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/qyudkcbbvskjtwb\/?name=tag_as_trigger_condition.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tag_as_trigger_condition.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Dropdown custom fields also create ticket tags and they can also be used in automations,         macros, and triggers as well. See <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/276290-build-custom-workflows-with-tags\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Build custom workflows with tags<\/a> in the Zendesk         forums for an example of how custom field tags can be used in a trigger.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/21 06:34:12 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":7,"id":20011393,"forum_id":20004401,"submitter_id":28633492,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":426,"created_at":"2011\/04\/07 08:54:23 -0700","title":"Using placeholders","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":[""],"body":"<!--?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?-->\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/n6hghytvtka4qrh\/?name=zug_watermark.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"zug_watermark.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Placeholders are references to ticket and user data that you include in the subject and text       of email notifications.

These are referred to as system placeholders. When you add custom fields, they         are also available as placeholders. Custom fields are not included in the list of available         placeholders, but they follow this simple naming         pattern:<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">{{ticket.ticket_field_<em>&lt;field ID number&gt;<\/em>}}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">For example, a custom field like this has the following placeholder:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_nfp_nja_vb__image_egs_gyv_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/hc7mzvnopzhhri1\/?name=placeholder_custom_field.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"placeholder_custom_field.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">{{ticket.ticket_field_505156}}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">When you create custom fields an ID is automatically generated. You can find the ID for a         custom field by selecting <strong>Manage &gt; Ticket Fields<\/strong>, locating your custom field in         the list, and then clicking <strong>Edit<\/strong>. The ID is displayed in the right column, as shown         here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_nfp_nja_vb__image_aab_dwv_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/sthgbnfddomks6u\/?name=custom_field_ID.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"custom_field_ID.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The placeholder name for the options in a custom drop-down list follows a different         pattern:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">{{ticket.ticket_field_option_title_<em>&lt;field ID number&gt;<\/em>}}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">For example, the placeholder for a drop-down list would look like this:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_nfp_nja_vb__image_aqa_qyv_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ju69xgqyrs2mbgf\/?name=placeholder_custom_dd.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"placeholder_custom_dd.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">{{ticket.ticket_field_option_title_515416}}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">There's only one placeholder for all three drop-down list options because this is a         reference to the option that was selected. The ID is for the custom drop-down list because         options do not have IDs. Again, this is a reference to the single option that was selected.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can use the placeholders for your custom fields as you would any other system         placeholder.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","updated_at":"2011\/05\/16 13:54:55 -0700","pinned_index":null,"votes_count":null,"posts_count":0,"id":20011631,"forum_id":20004401,"submitter_id":28633492,"flag_type_id":1,"is_public":true,"is_highlighted":false,"organization_id":null},{"position":null,"is_locked":false,"hits":399,"created_at":"2011\/04\/07 08:49:24 -0700","title":"Streamlining workflow with time-based events and automations","is_pinned":false,"current_tags":["automation"],"body":"<!--?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?-->\r\n<p><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/n6hghytvtka4qrh\/?name=zug_watermark.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"zug_watermark.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Automations are similar to triggers (see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20011606-streamlining-workflow-with-ticket-updates-and-triggers\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Streamlining workflow with ticket updates and       triggers<\/a>) because both define conditions and actions that modify ticket properties and       optionally send email notifications to customers and the support staff. Where they differ is       that automations run when a time event occurs (from one hour to 28 days) after a ticket       property was set or updated, rather than immediately after a ticket is created or updated.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Only admins can create and manage automations.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">Automations help you to manage the workflow and measure performance because they can alert       you to tickets that remain unresolved and need to be escalated (for example). Here are some       common uses for automations:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_deq_ixy_tb\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_deq_ixy_tb\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Notifying agents when an assigned ticket remains unresolved for x number of hours<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Notifying agent groups when a new ticket remains unassigned for x number of hours<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Notifying the assigned agent after x number of hours when a pending ticket has been           updated by the requester<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Closing tickets x number of days after they have been set to solved<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Zendesk provides an automation that demonstrates one of these common uses, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_aib_wjb_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/ngxounwhiwly2ls\/?name=automation_conditions_96hrs.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"automation_conditions_96hrs.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">This automation closes tickets 96 hours after they have been solved (96 hours is a help desk       best practice for the minimum amount of time a ticket should remain in the solved state before       it is closed). When the automation runs, any tickets that meet these criteria are closed. The       close action looks like this:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_jri_wjb_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/zvpyn5xkokrwiok\/?name=automation_actions_96hrs.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"automation_actions_96hrs.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> This example also illustrates an important rule of automations, which is: <strong><em>an           automation must contain an action that cancels a condition<\/em><\/strong>. The \u2018Status equals       Solved\u2019 condition is canceled by the \u2018Status equals Closed\u2019 action. If there were no canceling       action in this trigger, the automation would continue to fire in an endless loop because the       status would remain solved (not closed) and would therefore continue to meet the condition       criteria. If this trigger also contained an email notification action, the requester would       continue to receive the same notification emails until the automation was aborted.<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Unlike triggers, automations do not run whenever a ticket is updated. Automations run once       every hour and only on tickets that have been updated in the last 30 days.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> All automations are run at the top of the hour in batches for all Zendesk customers.         When exactly your automations run depends on how many automations and tickets there are to         process. For example, if a ticket was updated at 10am and your automation is set to run an         hour later, it might be slightly longer than that (11:04 or 11:10, etc.). Automations don't         run exactly x number of hours after the conditions are met.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The order of your automations is important as well because all automations run (first to       last) every hour.  When you create an automation, it is by default added to the end of the       list of automations. You can reorder the list of automations but you should only do so if you       understand how the other automations work and what actions they contain, because an action in       an automation can change the result of an action in another automation or cause a trigger to       be fired.

These include conditions you\u2019d expect such as priority, status,           assignee and so on. Because automations are based on the hours that have elapsed since a           ticket update was made, Zendesk provides the following time-based conditions:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_xcq_eaz_tb__ul_lgu_iaz_tb\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic_xcq_eaz_tb__ul_lgu_iaz_tb\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since created<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since opened<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since pending<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since solved<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since closed<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since assigned<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since update<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since requester update<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since assignee update<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Hours since due date (for tickets with the type set to Task)<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">These <em>hours since<\/em> conditions should require no further explain; the other           conditions you can use in your automations are described in the following table.\r\n<div class=\"tablenoborder\"><a name=\"topic_xcq_eaz_tb__table_nkk_bbz_tb\"><\/a> \r\n<table id=\"topic_xcq_eaz_tb__table_nkk_bbz_tb\" class=\"table\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" frame=\"border\" rules=\"all\">\r\n<caption><span class=\"tablecap\">Table 1.

This saves your             agents the time and effort of crafting a separate response to each customer that has the             same issue.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Macros can be created from scratch or you can base them on existing tickets. Macros             contain actions, which can be updates to ticket properties and comments to both             customers and the support staff. Macros are manually applied to tickets by agents.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">There are two types of macros: personal macros (created by an agent or admin for their             own use) and shared macros (created by an admin for everyone's use). A personal macro is             only visible to and can only be used or modified by the agent or admin who created it.             Admins can create shared macros and also modify all shared macros, regardless of who             created them.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Macros can also be organized into categories to help the support staff quickly locate and             apply them.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_lty_vgx_tb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_lty_vgx_tb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Zendesk macros to get you started<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Zendesk provides a number of macros to get you started.

As your list of macros grows, you may                 find it difficult to quickly locate macros when you\u2019re trying to apply one to a                 ticket. You can remedy this by organizing your macros into categories. You do this                 by including the categories in your macro titles and separating them with two                 colons, as in this example:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_fvl_bnx_tb__image_yts_cya_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/txjprkgbfcwp9dj\/?name=macro_title_category.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"macro_title_category.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can create up to three levels of categories. This macro title indicates that                 you\u2019re assigning the ticket to yourself and setting the Type property to                 Question.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The <strong>Apply Macro<\/strong> menu (available when you\u2019re creating and updating tickets)                 automatically displays categorization like this:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_fvl_bnx_tb__image_nkn_oya_xb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/y0danokijkugcji\/?name=macro_categories_new.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"macro_categories_new.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_urb_inx_tb\" class=\"topic nested2\"><a name=\"topic_urb_inx_tb\"><\/a>\r\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">Reordering the list of macros<\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can also reorder your list of macros, which affects what you see in the                         <strong>Apply Macro<\/strong> menu. Agents can only reorder their personal macros.

Reordering the                         list of macros simply reorders the list in the <strong>Apply Macro<\/strong> menu.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_goy_unx_tb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_goy_unx_tb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Deleting and deactivating macros<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">If you decide that you no longer need a macro you can either delete it or deactivate                 it. Deleting it of course means that it\u2019s gone and can\u2019t be retrieved. You can                 instead deactivate a macro so that it does not appear in the <strong>Apply Macro<\/strong> menu                 and therefore cannot be used. Deactivated macros are listed in a separate table on                     <strong>Manage &gt; Macros<\/strong> and can be reactivated if needed. Agents can only                 delete and deactivate their personal macros.

It's the templating language we use to enable them. Placeholders are used throughout the help desk (automations, macros, targets, triggers, and widgets) as containers for dynamically generated ticket and user data. What you may not know about Liquid markup is that you can also use it to customize how this data is selected and displayed as output. This is because Liquid also allows you to create simple programming logic such as case statements, if statements, for loops, and so on.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">By writing simple control statements directly in the comment\/description action in macros and the email user action in automations and triggers, you can accomplish in one automation, macro, or trigger what you used to have to do in multiple automations, macros, and triggers. You can also customize how comment text is presented.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_vfj_psm_ic\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_vfj_psm_ic\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">A brief introduction to Liquid markup<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can find the Liquid documentation at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tobi\/liquid\/wiki\/liquid-for-designers\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid for Designers<\/a>. All of the elements of the language are described in detail. Here, however, is a brief introduction to how it works.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Liquid is a templating language for rendering email and HTML. In Zendesk, Liquid is the mechanism that enables the automated placement of data in comments and email notifications using placeholders.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">There are two types of markup in Liquid:<a name=\"topic_vfj_psm_ic__ul_jpx_aqb_jc\"><\/a>\r\n<ul id=\"topic_vfj_psm_ic__ul_jpx_aqb_jc\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Output, which is text output contained in double curly brackets.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Tags, which contain the programming logic that determines how the data is expressed with placeholders.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If you simply equate <strong><em>output<\/em><\/strong> with <strong><em>placeholder<\/em><\/strong>, you're about half way to understanding what Liquid is and how it's used in Zendesk. What you may not know about Liquid output however is that in addition to expressing ticket and user data, there are also methods available to manipulate text strings and arrays. In Liquid, these methods are referred to as <em><strong>filters<\/strong><\/em>. Using a filter you can transform text to uppercase characters, for example. But that's one of the simplest examples of what filters can be used for. See the Liquid documentation for more information.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The other half of understanding of how Liquid can be used in Zendesk comes from knowing what tags are and how they are used. Tags provide the programming logic that you can use to select and present data.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Using Liquid tags you can create:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_vfj_psm_ic__ul_ukb_uon_ic\"><\/a>\r\n<ul id=\"topic_vfj_psm_ic__ul_ukb_uon_ic\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">if else statements<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">case statements<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">for loops<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">cycles<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">variable assignments<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">As an example, based on ticket properties you can create different responses in your business rules. This example shows how you can modify the <strong>Notify requester of received request<\/strong> trigger (or any other trigger that serves the same purpose) to return a response based on your business hours.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\"><strong>{% if ticket.in_business_hours %}<\/strong> \r\n \r\nHello {{ticket.requester.first_name}}\r\n \r\nYour request (#{{ticket.id}}) has been received and is being reviewed by our support staff. \r\n \r\nTo review the status of the request and add additional comments, follow the link below:\r\nhttp:\/\/{{ticket.url}}\r\n \r\n{{ticket.comments_formatted}}\r\n \r\n<strong>{% else %}<\/strong> \r\n \r\nHello {{ticket.requester.first_name}}\r\n \r\nYour request (#{{ticket.id}}) has been received and will be reviewed by our support staff during regular business hours (Monday - Friday, 8am - 6pm PST). \r\n \r\nTo review the status of the request and add additional comments, follow the link below:\r\nhttp:\/\/{{ticket.url}}\r\n \r\n{{ticket.comments_formatted}}\r\n \r\n<strong>{% endif %}<\/strong><\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Using a simple if...else statement, the first response is sent if the request is received during business hours and the other is sent if it is not. The if statement tests the<samp class=\"ph codeph\">ticket.in_business_hours<\/samp>property and responds accordingly. The ticket property is in the same format that you're familiar with when it's used as a placeholder, although not contained within double curly brackets for the simple reason that it's not being used as output here but rather as part of the logic determining what will be included in the comment when it's sent to the requester as an email notification.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">For several other examples of how these simple statements can be used in Zendesk, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_snv_nqh_jc\">Supporting multiple languages in automations, macros, and triggers<\/a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_xkn_sqh_jc\">Customizing the formatting and placement of text in comments and email notifications<\/a> below.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">These are just several examples of what you can do with these simple but powerful Liquid tags.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_yoh_grh_jc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_yoh_grh_jc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Using Liquid markup in Zendesk<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<div class=\"p\">Here are several more examples of how Liquid markup is commonly used in business rules to customize comments and email notifications.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> You may find it convenient to test your Liquid markup in a test macro since you can see the results immediately by applying the macro to a ticket.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_snv_nqh_jc\" class=\"topic nested2\"><a name=\"topic_snv_nqh_jc\"><\/a>\r\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">Supporting multiple languages in automations, macros, and triggers<\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Many help desks support end-users who speak languages other than English and there are a number of ways to manage this in Zendesk. In this example, a case statement is used to determine what response is sent to the end-user based on their language setting. The email body of the <strong>Notify requester of received request<\/strong> trigger contains the following Liquid markup:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\"><strong>{% case ticket.requester.language %} {% when 'Italiano' %}<\/strong> \r\n \r\nCiao {{ticket.requester.first_name}}\r\n \r\nLa tua richiesta (#{{ticket.id}}) \u00e8 stata ricevuta, \u00e8 stato esaminato dal nostro staff di assistenza.\r\n \r\nPer esaminare lo stato della richiesta e aggiungere ulteriori commenti, segui il link qui sotto:\r\nhttp:\/\/{{ticket.url}}\r\n \r\n{{ticket.comments_formatted}}\r\n \r\n<strong>{% else %} <\/strong> \r\n \r\n<strong>{% when 'Danish' %}<\/strong> \r\n \r\nHej {{ticket.requester.first_name}}\r\n \r\nDin anmodning (# {{ticket.id}}) er blevet modtaget og bliver gennemg\u00e5et af vores supportmedarbejdere.\r\n \r\nAt gennemg\u00e5 status for anmodningen og tilf\u00f8je yderligere kommentarer, skal du f\u00f8lge nedenst\u00e5ende link:\r\nhttp:\/\/ {{ticket.url}}\r\n \r\n{{ticket.comments_formatted}}\r\n \r\n<strong>{% else %} <\/strong> \r\n \r\nHello {{ticket.requester.first_name}}\r\n \r\nYour request (#{{ticket.id}}) has been received, and is being reviewed by our support staff. \r\n \r\nTo review the status of the request and add additional comments, follow the link below:\r\nhttp:\/\/{{ticket.url}}\r\n \r\n{{ticket.comments_formatted}}\r\n \r\n<strong>{% endcase %}<\/strong><\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The language preference is set in the user's profile. Language support is defined by an admin (<strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Localization &gt; Languages<\/strong>) and you use the names (the exact text string) as displayed in the list of languages on that page.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> This example just shows the notify trigger. You'd also want to do the same thing for the update and solved triggers and any other business rules that generate comments and email notifications to the end-user.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">In this example, we could have also explicitly declared the English text like the others ({% when 'English' %}). However, if the default language of the help desk is English it's not necessary. The English text will be displayed to all users who have not otherwise chosen a language setting.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">As you can imagine, you can use something like this for any number of reasons, not just to support multiple languages. For example, maybe you want custom responses for users in different organizations for some reason. If so, you use<samp class=\"ph codeph\">ticket.organization.name<\/samp>in a case statement like this.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_xkn_sqh_jc\" class=\"topic nested2\"><a name=\"topic_xkn_sqh_jc\"><\/a>\r\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">Customizing the formatting and placement of text in comments and email notifications<\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">By default, many of the Zendesk business rules use the {{ticket.comments_formatted}} placeholder to include comments into email notifications. If you want more control over how the comments are presented to requesters, you can access more details about comments and their attachments using Liquid markup.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">A comment is an element within a ticket and there are a number of placeholders available that you can use to include comments in email notifications. For example, you can include all comments, public comments, the last comment, etc (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_xud_vxb_jc\">Comment data<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If you want more control over how comments are displayed in email notifications, you can use Liquid markup and a for loop, as in this example:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">{% for comment in ticket.comments %}\r\n \r\n   Comment:\r\n   {{comment.created_at}}\r\n   {{comment.author.name}}\r\n   {{comment.value}}\r\n \r\n   Attachment:\r\n   {% for attachment in comment.attachments %}\r\n   {{attachment.filename}}\r\n   {{attachment.url}} \r\n \r\n   {% endfor %}\r\n \r\n{% endfor %}<\/pre>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">This returns the items in both arrays (ticket.comments and comment. attachments). In other words, the properties for every comment and attachment contained in the ticket.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">If you want to only return the last comment, you can use the<samp class=\"ph codeph\">limit<\/samp>and<samp class=\"ph codeph\">offset<\/samp>attributes as in the following example:\r\n<pre class=\"pre\">{% for comment in ticket.comments limit:1 offset:0 %}<\/pre>\r\nYou can do a lot with arrays in for loops. Refer to the Liquid documentation (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tobi\/liquid\/wiki\/liquid-for-designers\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid for Designers<\/a>) for more details.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_okl_mwb_jc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_okl_mwb_jc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Zendesk data object (placeholders) reference<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Zendesk placeholders are containers for dynamically generated ticket and user data. The format is a data reference contained within double curly brackets. Since you can also access ticket and user data when defining programming logic, it may be helpful to think beyond placeholders and think instead of data objects and their properties that can be used for either purpose.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">There are two primary data objects in Zendesk: Ticket and User. Each has its own set of properties; the User object, for example, contains user properties such as name and email. In addition to these two data objects, there are associated data objects.

They       provide the same level of service, but their end-users don't have access to the Web portal to       view or track their requests. Instead, all communication between agents and end-users occurs       using channels such as email, and voice, and chat.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Regardless of the channel by which new requests are submitted, requests become tickets that       agents manage in the help desk by using views, creating and applying macros, generating       reports, and so on. All communication between agents and end-users is captured on those       tickets and emails are sent back and forth between both parties. The only change for the       end-user denied access to the help desk is that they track their requests in email.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">Your end-users request support and interact with your help desk and agents (without logging       in) by using the following channels:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_hyf_wty_yb\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_hyf_wty_yb\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Sending email directly to your support email address (for example,             support@<em>mycompany<\/em>.zendesk.com)<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Submitting a support request using the Zendesk dropbox<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Chatting with an agent<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Leaving a voicemail<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Sending a request using Twitter<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">All of these channels can be used to generate requests without requiring end-users to log in;       however, one aspect of the Web portal experience that you probably don't want to deny your       end-users is access to your knowledge base and participation in your community. You can       achieve this without requiring them to log in by:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_rnf_yuy_yb\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_rnf_yuy_yb\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Providing your end-users with the link to your knowledge base and forums (for example,             http:\/\/<em>mycompany<\/em>.zendesk.com\/forums)<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Using the Zendesk dropbox with knowledge base search enabled<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The advantage of using the Zendesk dropbox is that your end-users are provided with a simple       request form (that also displays your custom fields) coupled with a search of your knowledge       base and, optionally, live chat with your support agents, as shown here:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_vya_gmy_yb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/u8skekr2tgjoufo\/?name=dropbox_initial.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"dropbox_initial.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic-1__image_jmp_hmy_yb\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/u0u662rqfboecvw\/?name=dropbox_request.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"dropbox_request.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can add the dropbox to your help desk or to any web page you choose.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If you choose to point your end-users directly to your forums, you'll need to make a few       changes to the Web portal user interface to remove links to log in, sign up, get a password,       and submit requests (see <a href=\"#topic_odm_ans_yb\" class=\"xref\">Hiding end-user access         links in the Web portal<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">Setting up your help desk to provide support without also requiring end-users to log in       involves the following:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_lvf_vds_yb\"><\/a> \r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_lvf_vds_yb\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Allowing anyone to submit requests and hiding the requirement to log in<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Modifying the email notification template to remove all URLs to the help desk<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Modifying triggers to remove all URLs to the help desk<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Adding a CSS and a JavaScript widget to hide links to register, log in, and submit           requests<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_msc_mes_yb\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_msc_mes_yb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Updating end-user settings to create an open help desk<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">To allow requests without requiring end-users to log in to help desk, you need to modify         account settings to create an open help desk.

You'll probably want to also         allow your end-users to add attachements to their email requests. If you don't currently         have this enabled, you can do so by selecting <strong>Settings &gt; Tickets &gt; Attachments &gt;           Customers can attach files<\/strong>.

They access your help desk at the usual URL (http:\/\/<em class=\"ph i\">mycompany<\/em>.zendesk.com) but logging in happens through the WordPress log in page, which is displayed when they click the login link in the help desk. When they are successfully authenticated by WordPress, they are seamlessly logged in to the help desk.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Once you've set up remote authentication, all user management and authentication happens in WordPress, not in Zendesk. In other words, you don't add or manage help desk users in Zendesk. All of that happens in WordPress.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If you switch to remote authentication after you've already set up users in Zendesk, they will no longer have access to those user accounts (their old Zendesk login). You can however make sure that their former help desk identity is associated with their WordPress user account by using the same email address in both user accounts. In other words, if a user's WordPress account uses the same email address as their Zendesk acount, the two accounts will be synced. If a different address is used, a separate user account is created.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><strong class=\"ph b\">To configure remote authentication for the Zendesk for WordPress plugin<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">This process is a back and forth between your WordPress site and Zendesk.

The request becomes a         ticket and they are added as new end-users and are identified by their email address.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If your help desk requires end-users to register, a first time requester receives a welcome         email with a verification link that prompts them to enter a password and log in. Doing this         verifies them as end-users in your help desk. These end-users get full use of the Web portal (Home         page, knowledge base and community forums, new request page, and a view of their tickets).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If your help desk does not require end-users to log in (for example, if you run an email         only help desk), they won't receive the welcome email. They track their requests and         communicate with agents using email. For more information about supporting unregistered         end-users, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/entries\/20032793-setting-up-an-email-only-help-desk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"xref\">Setting up an email only help desk<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Users can also submit requests using Twitter, which also adds them to the help desk. The         user's Twitter ID is the account identifier. Any other relevant help desk user profile         information that can be pulled from their Twitter profile, such as their name, is added to         the user's profile.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">If the Twitter requester is already registered in the help desk and their Twitter account         has been added to their help desk profile, they are recognized as a registered user. If         their Twitter account has not been added to their profile, a duplicate user account is         created. The duplicate account can be merged into their original account. See <a href=\"#topic_opj_hfm_dc\" class=\"xref\">Merging a user's duplicate account<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_nku_eaf_dc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_nku_eaf_dc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Editing and deleting users<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">All registered users can update their own profiles. Restrictions are only placed on the         role and privileges settings. End-users cannot change their role or the organization they         belong to. Agents can change their organization but not their group assignments. Admins can         change everything for everyone except the account owner.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Deleting users can be done by agents and admins. Agents can delete end-users and admins can         delete all users (except for the account owner). You cannot delete end-users that have         tickets that are not closed. This also applies to admins and agents. If they are requesters         on tickets that aren't closed, you can't delete them. When you delete an admin or agent, all         of the tickets they are assigned to become unassigned.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_uag_cjm_dc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_uag_cjm_dc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Multiple email addresses for user accounts<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">A user account can contain multiple email addresses.

You can change the primary email address to any of the other email addresses.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">Each time you add an email address, a verification email is sent to that address and must         be confirmed before the email address is valid.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_opj_hfm_dc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_opj_hfm_dc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Merging a user's duplicate account<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Since end-users can submit requests using different email addresses and via Twitter,         duplicate end-user accounts can be created in the help desk.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The user profile allows you to enter multiple email addresses for a user and then set one         as primary, which means that regardless of the email address they use to submit a request,         they are properly identified by the help desk and a new user account is not created.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">A duplicate user account can also be created if the end-user submits a request via Twitter         and their Twitter account has not been added to their user profile.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">To handle multiple accounts for the same end-user, you can merge one end-user account into         another end-user account. You can only merge registered (verified) end-users.

You establish sharing agreements with other help desks and specify the terms under which sharing can occur, and how shared tickets are managed between help desks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">Ticket sharing allows you to assign tickets to affiliated help desks, and their agents either provide information toward resolving the issue or solve the issue themselves. The ticket status and comments can stay synced between the tickets in each help desk.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\">Here's how ticket sharing works: <a name=\"topic-1__ul_wqq_edz_kc\"><\/a>\r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_wqq_edz_kc\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Any help desk can invite another help desk to establish a sharing agreement.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">The initiating help desk (referred to as the sender) sets the terms of the sharing agreement, which the receiving help desk can accept or decline.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Sharing agreements are one way. Once the receiver accepts the agreement, the sender may share tickets with the receiver. For the receiver to share tickets with the sender, they must create and initiate a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;sharing relationship with the other help desk.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">The sender can only share one ticket with one other help desk. However, the receiver can share the ticket with a help desk that they have a sharing agreement with.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">A shared ticket becomes a new ticket in the receiver's help desk with a separate ticket ID.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">The ticket status and comments can remain synced between the ticket versions in both help desks, depending on the permissions set in the agreement.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Depending on the terms of the agreement, the receiver help desk may directly communicate with the ticket requester and solve the ticket.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Each help desk's business rules remain separate. For example, when a ticket is solved the status can be synced between the two help desks, but when it is closed in each depends on their own business rules.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">A help desk can automatically refuse to accept all sharing agreement invites.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Sharing agreements can be deactivated at any time by either the sender or the receiver.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">A sharing agreement grants another help desk permission to work on your tickets. You can grant another help desk one of the two following permissions:<a name=\"topic-1__ul_gxq_pra_lc\"><\/a>\r\n<ul id=\"topic-1__ul_gxq_pra_lc\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Make public &amp; private comments, sync status<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Make private comments, do not sync status<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">The first option allows the receiver help desk to communicate directly with the requester and to change the ticket status (for example, setting it to Solved). These ticket updates are also reflected in the sender's version of the ticket.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"p\">\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> Although the receiver help desk may be allowed to make public comments and directly interact with the requester, email notifications will link back to the help desk where the request was originally submitted.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"note note\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p class=\"p\">The second option (private comments only and no status syncing) limits the other help desk to providing you with information needed to resolve the support request. For example, imagine a company that builds something that includes components from other companies. Each affiliated company (business partner) can set up a help desk and a sharing agreement to provide more details on issues related to the components they supply. In this scenario, the sender help desk controls the ticket from initial request through to resolution, gathering information as needed from the affiliated help desk.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc\" class=\"topic nested1\"><a name=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc\"><\/a>\r\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Setting up a ticket sharing agreement<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"body\">\r\n<p class=\"p\">To set up ticket sharing an admin creates a ticket sharing invite and defines the terms (permissions) of the sharing agreement.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"p\"><strong>To create a ticket sharing invite<\/strong><a name=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc__ol_lli_nhz_kc\"><\/a><ol id=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc__ol_lli_nhz_kc\" class=\"ol\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">Select <strong>Settings &gt; Tickets &gt; Ticket Sharing<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Select <strong>Add Sharing Invite<\/strong>. <a name=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc__ul_qpo_thz_kc\"><\/a>\r\n<ul id=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc__ul_qpo_thz_kc\" class=\"ul\">\r\n<li class=\"li\">The sharing invite looks like this:\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_kjg_hhz_kc__image_tvy_rfl_kc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/h6t5oriy5rxnemv\/?name=ticket_sharing_invite.png\" alt=\"ticket_sharing_invite.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Enter the name of another Zendesk account as the receiver subdomain.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li\">Select the comment and status permission.

The conditions <strong>Ticket source<\/strong> and <strong>Ticket update via<\/strong> include <strong>Ticket sharing<\/strong> as a value.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">You can create a view of the tickets generated from ticket sharing, as in this example:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\"><a name=\"topic_ktu_ttz_kc__image_uep_pua_lc\"><\/a><img src=\"\/attachments\/token\/364f7dum13rzotg\/?name=ticket_sharing_view.png\" alt=\"ticket_sharing_view.png\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p\">This will show you all the tickets that were shared to you.
